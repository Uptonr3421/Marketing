================================================================================
VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

For each business, multiple web searches were conducted using:
- Business name + owner name combinations
- Business name + location combinations
- Specific claims (awards, dates, achievements)
- Contact names in quotes to find exact matches
- Social media platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)
- Media mentions (news articles, press releases)
- Business directories (BBB, Think Plexus, ZipsGuide)
- Review platforms (Yelp, Google)

Each factual claim was cross-referenced against 2+ independent sources where possible.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: All 8 files must have their CONTACT fields corrected
to reflect actual business owners. The systematic nature of these errors suggests
the contact information may have been:
- Incorrectly transcribed from another source
- Mixed up with a different data set
- Populated with placeholder/test names

Do NOT use these files for outreach until CONTACT names are verified and corrected.

The rest of the information in these files is largely accurate and well-researched,
with most claims verified through multiple independent sources.
