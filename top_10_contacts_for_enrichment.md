## Notes & Considerations

1. **Email Name Mismatches**: Several contacts show different names in "First Name, Last Name" vs. email address (e.g., Jessica Middlebrook but email is William.Auer@...). This requires verification before outreach.

2. **Shared Inboxes**: Some emails may be team/department inboxes rather than individual contacts. Verify before personalized outreach.

3. **Privacy & Compliance**: Ensure all outreach complies with CAN-SPAM, GDPR (if applicable), and professional networking guidelines.

4. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have 10 deeply researched, highly personalized contacts than 100 generic ones.

5. **Iterative Learning**: Use insights from first 10 to improve approach for next tier of contacts.
