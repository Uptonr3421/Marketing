SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. CONTACT NAME ACCURACY CRISIS: 7 out of 13 files (54%) contain contact names that DO NOT MATCH email addresses or cannot be verified through search results. This is a MAJOR data integrity issue.

2. DATE ERRORS: Multiple incorrect dates found:
   - Studio West 117: Grand opening listed as 2023, actually October 2022
   - Sophie La Gourmande: Cleveland Scene article listed as 2024, actually October 2022
   - Shiny Penny Studios: Founded listed as 2018, appears to be 2019

3. MISSING CRITICAL INFORMATION:
   - Studio West 117: File completely omits financial troubles (defaulted on $9M in loans) and community controversies
   - Sits n Wiggles: Missing co-founder Hannah Smith

4. OWNER/FOUNDER NAME CLARIFICATIONS:
   - STEM Handmade Soap: File says "Dave and Steve" - should specify Steve Meka and Dave Willett
   - Safe Pass Driving School: Misleading description makes Rob and Kristen Swinton sound like two unrelated people named "Swinton" and "Kristen"

RECOMMENDATION: Immediate review and correction of all contact names. Cross-reference email addresses with actual business ownership/staff. Verify all dates with multiple sources. Add context about business challenges where publicly known and relevant.
