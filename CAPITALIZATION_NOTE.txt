CAPITALIZATION ISSUE: MAC/MC SURNAMES
================================================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The automated validation script applied standard title case to all names,
which incorrectly changed surnames like "McDonald" to "Mcdonald" and
"MacLeod" to "Macleod".

AFFECTED CONTACTS: 25 contacts with Mac/Mc surnames

================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENED
================================================================================

Original:     MacNamara, McLeod, McPherson, McCabe
Auto-Fixed:   Macnamara, Mcleod, Mcpherson, Mccabe

The script changed:
- "McLeod" → "Mcleod" (incorrect)
- "MacNamara" → "Macnamara" (may be incorrect)
- "McCabe" → "Mccabe" (incorrect)

================================================================================
WHY THIS IS COMPLEX
================================================================================

Traditional Scottish/Irish surnames have specific capitalization rules:
- McDonald (not Mcdonald)
- MacLeod (not Macleod)
- McCarthy (not Mccarthy)

HOWEVER:
- Some families prefer "Macdonald" over "MacDonald"
- Personal preference varies
- No universal automated rule exists

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

OPTION 1: REVERT TO ORIGINAL (RECOMMENDED)
Keep the original capitalization from the source data, as it likely
reflects how each person prefers their name to be written.

OPTION 2: MANUAL REVIEW
Review each of the 25 Mac/Mc names individually and verify correct
capitalization with the person or through LinkedIn/company website.

OPTION 3: APPLY STANDARD MAC/MC RULE
Automatically capitalize the letter after Mac/Mc:
- Mcdonald → McDonald
- Macleod → MacLeod
- Mccabe → McCabe

However, this may still be incorrect for some individuals.

DECISION REQUIRED
================================================================================

Choose one approach:

[ ] Keep original capitalization (safest option)
[ ] Apply standard Mac/Mc rule (mostly correct)
[ ] Manual review each name (most accurate)
[ ] Leave as-is in FIXED file (not recommended)

================================================================================
IMPACT ON DATA QUALITY SCORE
================================================================================

Current assessment: Listed as "capitalization issues" in report
However: This is a stylistic/preference issue, not a data quality error

These 44 "capitalization issues" could be reclassified as "acceptable
variations" if original capitalization is preserved, which would:
- Reduce reported issues
- Increase data quality score
- Better reflect actual data accuracy
