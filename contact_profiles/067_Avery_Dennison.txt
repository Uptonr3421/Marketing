Email Body:
Hi Tony,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's April 2025 sustainability white paper on recycling impact.

With 8% of stock becoming waste and costing 3.6% of profits, supply chain optimization is critical. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI demand forecasting: Reduce inventory waste by 30-40% through predictive analytics

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
