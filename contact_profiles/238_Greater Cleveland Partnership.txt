Email Body:
Hi Kelley,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed GCP's successful execution of multiple 2025 summits including the Annual Event and BIG Summit.

Coordinating multiple large-scale events while measuring real impact and ROI takes significant manual effort. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated event management: Streamlines registration, tracks engagement patterns, and provides real-time attendee insights.
- AI-driven ROI measurement: Analyzes post-event feedback and converts qualitative data into actionable metrics.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
