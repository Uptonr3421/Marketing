Maximizing Your Positive Free Cash Flow

Email Body:
Hi Cord,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow.

ATM downtime costs banks millions while valuable IoT data goes underutilized. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive maintenance AI: Machine learning algorithms analyze sensor data to predict ATM failures before they occur, reducing downtime by 50% and eliminating repeat service calls.
- Operational analytics integration: AI transforms your IoT and fleet data into real-time operational insights, optimizing technician dispatch and parts inventory.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
