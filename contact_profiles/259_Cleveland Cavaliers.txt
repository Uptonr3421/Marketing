Email Body:
Hi G.,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavs' historic 64-18 season and #1 seed clinch.

With sold-out games, how do you personalize 20,000 fan experiences while identifying at-risk season ticket holders? I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI fan sentiment analysis: Identify VIP opportunities and retention risks in real-time from social/ticketing data.
- Predictive journey mapping: Personalize 20,000 fan experiences across digital touchpoints automatically.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
