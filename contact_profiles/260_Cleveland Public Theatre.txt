Hi Amanda,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPT's transformative $6M Horvitz bequest and capital campaign milestone.

With $12M goal in sight, how do you identify major donor prospects while personalizing outreach to 5,000+ supporters? I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI prospect research: Identify high-capacity donors aligned with CPT's mission from public data.
- Automated personalized campaigns: Adapt messaging by engagement level for 5,000+ contacts.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
