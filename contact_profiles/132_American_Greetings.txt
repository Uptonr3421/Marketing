Hi Cindy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' exciting growth phase following Elliott Investment's acquisition and CEO Arcuri's innovation vision.

Scaling talent acquisition during rapid expansion strains HR resources. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
