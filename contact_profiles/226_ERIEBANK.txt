Hi Hope,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed ERIEBANK's expansion to Cleveland with your new Seven Hills regional headquarters.

Scaling personalized service across multiple branches without losing that community bank touch is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- 24/7 AI customer service: Handle routine inquiries instantly while routing complex issues to your team
- Real-time fraud detection: Catch suspicious transactions automatically to protect customers

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
