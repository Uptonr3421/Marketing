Hi Uchechukwu,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Nestlé ranked 3rd of 300+ companies in packaged food ESG ratings.

Maintaining supply chain efficiency while meeting ambitious sustainability targets is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI supply chain optimization: Reduce waste and improve route efficiency to support zero-waste goals.
- Automated ESG tracking: Real-time dashboards that simplify compliance reporting and identify improvement opportunities.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
