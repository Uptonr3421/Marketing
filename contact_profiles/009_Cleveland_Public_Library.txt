Adult Ed Needs Personalization

Email Body:
Hi Kim,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL offering career counseling, GED classes, and skills training.

Personalizing learning paths for diverse adult students with limited staff is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Adaptive learning: AI tailors content to each student's pace
- Progress tracking: Automated recommendations based on learning patterns

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
