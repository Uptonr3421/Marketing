Your Peanuts Advent Calendar Innovation

Email Body:
Hi Michelle,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' Peanuts 75th anniversary digital Advent calendar.

Social media is capturing younger demographics who might otherwise buy greeting cards. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered CRM: Predictive models identify high-value customers, track key dates automatically, and recommend personalized engagement strategies that boost retention 30-45%.
- Customer experience optimization: Machine learning personalizes content recommendations and shopping journeys, increasing engagement with younger audiences by 40-60%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
