Email Body:
Hi Alyssa,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf launched its Branch Automation Solutions portfolio in August 2025.

Transforming traditional branches into advisory-led hubs requires optimizing every customer interaction and staff allocation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Customer Journey Optimization: Maps and streamlines every touchpoint to reduce wait times by 35% and increase satisfaction.
- Staff Scheduling Optimization: AI-driven scheduling cuts labor costs 20% while improving service coverage.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
