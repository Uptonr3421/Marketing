Maximizing Uptime at Avery Dennison

Email Body:
Hi Ignacio,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's 2025 CIO 100 Award for Project Loop's 20+ AI initiatives.

Unplanned downtime disrupts production schedules and increases costs despite automation gains. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive maintenance AI: Expand beyond the 25% downtime reduction in India to all facilities with advanced failure prediction.
- Quality control automation: Deploy computer vision to detect defects in real-time, reducing waste and rework.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
