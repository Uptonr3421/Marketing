Email Body:
Hi Juan,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Kerns' A+ BBB rating and Owens Corning partnership.

Insurance claims bog down roofing operations while seasonal scheduling creates costly gaps. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Claims Processor: Automates documentation and accelerates approvals by 60%.
- Smart Scheduling: Optimizes crew allocation based on weather and priorities, reducing downtime.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
