Hi Christopher,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' impressive IT modernization journey and AI-driven finance transformation.

Manual processes creating payment delays can hurt customer experience. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
