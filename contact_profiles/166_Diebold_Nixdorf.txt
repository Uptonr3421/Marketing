Hi Paul,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's ambitious growth targets for 2027 announced at Investor Day.

Retail sales down 7.8% with intensifying fintech competition threaten market share. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Customer Engagement: Personalize retail experiences to boost sales and combat fintech competition.
- Competitive Intelligence: Automate market analysis to identify opportunities and defend market position.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?
