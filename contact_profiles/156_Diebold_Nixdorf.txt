Plexus Member - Congrats on 200K ATM Milestone

Email Body:
Hi Kieran,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's 200,000 DN Series ATM shipment milestone.

Streamlining operations with a record $980M backlog requires efficiency gains. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Workflow Automation: Eliminates manual tasks in order processing and fulfillment, accelerating delivery cycles.
- Document Processing AI: Auto-extracts data from contracts and invoices, reducing processing time by 70%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
