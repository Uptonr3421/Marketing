Email Body:
Hi Anna,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed GCP honored 108 tech innovators at Best of Tech Awards with 300+ attendees.

With major events driving member value, how do you track engagement ROI and identify at-risk renewals? I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI member engagement scoring: Identify at-risk memberships and expansion opportunities from event/email data.
- Automated networking matchmaking: Increase member connections 40% with intelligent post-event introductions.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
