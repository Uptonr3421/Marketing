Hi Jackie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavaliers' remarkable #1 Eastern Conference seed.

Delivering exceptional fan experiences at scale during championship runs requires automation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Customer experience optimization: Automate personalized fan journeys across ticketing, concessions, and engagement touchpoints.
- Fan communication systems: Scale outreach to thousands while maintaining personalized interactions.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
