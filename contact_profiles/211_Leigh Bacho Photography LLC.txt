Hi Paige,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Lauren winning the Doug Pensinger Photography Fund grant and shooting for NBA/NFL/Getty.

Juggling major clients while managing social media and bookings spreads you thin. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

Best,
Upton Rand
