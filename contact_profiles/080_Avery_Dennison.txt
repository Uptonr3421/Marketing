Walmart Fresh RFID Partnership Breakthrough

Email Body:
Hi Susie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's October 2025 Walmart partnership bringing RFID to fresh categories.

Scaling technical support for major partnerships strains resources. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Customer Support: 24/7 intelligent technical assistance maintains quality while scaling partnerships.
- Smart Case Routing: AI prioritizes and routes inquiries for 40% faster partner response.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
