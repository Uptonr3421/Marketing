Hi Lawrence,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's groundbreaking Wiliot partnership scaling ambient IoT sensor manufacturing.

Rapid manufacturing scale-up strains production planning—supplier delays cascade. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Demand Forecasting: AI-powered predictions reduce stockouts 40% and optimize production schedules for new IoT products.
- Predictive Maintenance: Following your India plant success (25% downtime reduction), expand AI maintenance across facilities.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
