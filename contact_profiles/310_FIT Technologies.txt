Email Body:
Hi Nichole,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed FIT Technologies ranked #67 on the 2025 MSP 501 List.

Managing 160+ employees across diverse client sectors creates coordination challenges that slow project delivery. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Project Automation: Predicts bottlenecks and automates task allocation across your healthcare, education, and nonprofit clients.
- Client Communication System: Ensures consistent updates and reduces manual coordination for multi-sector projects.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
