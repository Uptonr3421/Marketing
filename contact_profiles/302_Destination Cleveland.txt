Email Body:
Hi Trevor,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland booked 300+ conventions bringing 208,000 visitors and $200M economic impact.

Coordinating hundreds of events across multiple venues creates scheduling conflicts and communication bottlenecks. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Event Scheduling AI: Automatically matches conventions with optimal venues, eliminating double-bookings and reducing planning time by 50%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
