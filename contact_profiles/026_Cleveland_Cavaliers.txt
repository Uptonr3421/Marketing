Hi Ian,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavaliers Foundation awarded $510K to 17 Northeast Ohio nonprofits this spring.

Proving sponsor ROI while scaling fan engagement across channels is increasingly complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Sponsor ROI AI: Shows exact value delivery across digital and arena activations.
- Fan analytics: Predicts which initiatives drive ticket sales and loyalty.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
