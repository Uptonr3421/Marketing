Hi Michael,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Playhouse Square is launching The Notebook and Hell's Kitchen national tours this season.

Managing complex tour logistics and forecasting audience demand across multiple shows is overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
