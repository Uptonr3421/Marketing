Email Body:
Hi Heather,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed ERIEBANK's commitment to serving small-to-medium businesses throughout Northeast Ohio with personalized service.

Loan processing bottlenecks slow approvals and frustrate customers expecting community bank speed. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated loan processing: Cut approval time by 50% while maintaining compliance
- AI risk assessment: Analyze creditworthiness in minutes with greater accuracy

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
