2030 Goals Need Better Data Integration

Email Body:
Hi Ana,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's comprehensive 2030 environmental and social sustainability goals.

Tracking progress across global facilities while managing different metrics and regulations is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Unified dashboard: Real-time view of all sustainability KPIs across every location
- Compliance automation: Stay ahead of changing environmental regulations automatically

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Best,
Upton Rand
