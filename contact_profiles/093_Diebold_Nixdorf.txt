Email Body:
Hi Tiffany,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your Vynamic Smart Vision rollout in 18 stores.

Retail shrinkage at self-checkout continues to erode margins despite security investments. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Shrink Detection: Computer vision identifies suspicious checkout behaviors in real-time, reducing loss by 35%+
- Customer Analytics: Predict high-risk transactions and optimize security resource allocation

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
