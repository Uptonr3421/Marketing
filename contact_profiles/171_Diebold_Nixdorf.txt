Hi Kristene,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf won multiple 2025 Global Banking & Finance Awards.

With workforce costs rising and skilled resource scarcity, integrating AI effectively remains challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Process Automation: Optimize branch operations and reduce workforce costs by 30-40%
- Intelligent Chatbots: Handle routine inquiries, freeing staff for high-value advisory services

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
