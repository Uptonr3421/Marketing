Hi Jacob,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Medical Mutual earned a 4.5-Star Medicare rating in 2024.

Manual claims processing causes errors that cost providers $500K annually in denials. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered claims processing: Reduces denial rates by 30% and improves first-pass claim accuracy by 25%.
- Predictive analytics: Identifies high-risk members before costly interventions are needed.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?
