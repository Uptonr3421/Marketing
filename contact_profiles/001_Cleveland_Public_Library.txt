Hi Alex,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL earning Library Journal's Five Star award every year since 2009.

Managing patron inquiries across 27 branches takes enormous coordination. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI chatbot: Handle routine patron questions 24/7, freeing staff for complex needs
- Workflow automation: Reduce administrative burden by 40%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
