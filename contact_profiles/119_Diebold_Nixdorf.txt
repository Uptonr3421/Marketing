Hi Robb,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's ambitious 12% retail growth target and 500-kiosk deployment.

- Retail Analytics Dashboard: Centralize performance data from all locations with real-time actionable insights.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
