Hi Michael,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Public Library celebrated its 100th anniversary with major tech upgrades.

Personalizing services for diverse community needs while managing 600+ upgraded computers requires smarter resource allocation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
