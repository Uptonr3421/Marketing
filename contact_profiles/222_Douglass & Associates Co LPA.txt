Email Body:
Hi Kimberly,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Douglass & Associates recovered hundreds of millions for clients since 1983.

Reviewing thousands of pages of contracts and litigation documents manually drains billable hours from client work. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Legal Document Analyzer: Extracts key terms, obligations, and risks from contracts in minutes, not hours.
- Case Research Assistant: Finds relevant precedents and citations instantly, cutting research time by 60%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
