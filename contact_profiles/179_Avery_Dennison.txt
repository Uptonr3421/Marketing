Enhancing Avery Dennison's Supply Chain Vision

Email Body:
Hi Katarina,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's breakthrough Walmart RFID partnership transforming fresh food tracking.

Supply chain visibility gaps slow decision-making and increase waste. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered supply chain visibility: Real-time tracking across all operations, eliminating blind spots and reducing waste by 30%.
- Predictive analytics for inventory: Forecast demand patterns to optimize stock levels and prevent shortages.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
