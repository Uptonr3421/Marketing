Hi Andrew,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Pride Band's 2025-26 concert series at Maltz.

Coordinating 80+ musicians across rehearsals and performances creates scheduling chaos. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

Best,
