Congrats on 18 Best Bank Awards

Email Body:
Hi Karmel,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Huntington won 18 "Best Bank" awards in February 2025 for innovative digital tools.

Maintaining 17% engagement in your AI-driven Marketplace while competing for digital-first customers requires constant innovation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-Powered Customer Engagement: Delivers hyper-personalized content that boosts engagement rates by 45% and retention by 30%.
- Personalized Banking Recommendations: Analyzes behavior patterns to suggest relevant products, increasing cross-sell success 50%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
