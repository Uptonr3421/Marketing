Hi Mrs. Kelly,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed PNC's balanced approach combining digital innovation with trusted human interaction.

With unclear AI ROI blocking implementation for many banks, strategic deployment is essential. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Customer Journey Automation: Streamline onboarding and account management while maintaining the personal touch PNC is known for.
- Intelligent Compliance Monitoring: Navigate complex regulations efficiently while reducing risk.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
