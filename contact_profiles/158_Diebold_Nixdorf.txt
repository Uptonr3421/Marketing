Plexus Member - Congrats on $800M Target

Email Body:
Hi Leslie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's ambitious $800M free cash flow target by 2027.

Driving operational efficiency across global operations to hit financial targets is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Process Automation Platform: Streamlines repetitive workflows in finance, HR, and operations, cutting costs 30%.
- Predictive Analytics: Identifies operational bottlenecks and optimization opportunities, accelerating cash flow improvements.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
