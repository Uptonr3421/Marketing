Email Body:
Hi Bryce,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Medical Mutual's focus on digital member portals and telemedicine.

Member support inquiries overwhelm staff during peak periods and delay responses. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI chatbots: Handle 80% of routine member inquiries instantly while escalating complex issues appropriately.
- Automated data entry: Eliminates manual input errors and frees staff for high-value member interactions.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
