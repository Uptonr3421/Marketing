Hi Amanda,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison won the 2024 MHI Best New Innovation in Sustainability award.

With expanding sustainability requirements, reporting complexity can overwhelm teams. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated ESG Reporting: Real-time sustainability metrics tracking and compliance documentation generation.
- AI Carbon Analysis: Predictive modeling to optimize carbon reduction across your supply chain.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
