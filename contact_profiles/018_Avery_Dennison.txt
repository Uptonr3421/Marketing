Hi Ryan,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your team's research showing 1% recycling increases can eliminate 2,000 tons of plastic waste.

Balancing supply chain efficiency with sustainability targets requires visibility into every step. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Supply chain AI: Predict demand patterns and optimize inventory to reduce waste
- Smart quality control: Catch defects early, reducing material waste by 25-40%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
