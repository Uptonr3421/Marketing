Managing CPL's Historic Renovation Plan

Email Body:
Hi Gary,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's ambitious 10-year plan to renovate or rebuild all 27 libraries.

Coordinating construction schedules while maintaining patron services across locations requires constant updates. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Project tracking: Real-time dashboards monitoring all 27 renovation projects simultaneously
- Auto-communications: Keep patrons updated on closures, service changes, and reopenings

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
