Hi Kara,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Douglass & Associates' impressive 40+ year track record serving Cleveland businesses in commercial litigation and creditors' rights.

Manual document review eats billable hours that could serve more clients. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
