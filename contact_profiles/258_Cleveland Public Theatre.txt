Email Body:
Hi Mary,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPT's SoftLaunch festival success and national recognition for new play development.

Building audiences for experimental new works requires identifying the right patrons. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI audience targeting: Identify potential theatre patrons through interest and behavioral analysis, filling more seats.
- Automated social media creator: Generate optimized content for each show, increasing engagement and ticket sales.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
