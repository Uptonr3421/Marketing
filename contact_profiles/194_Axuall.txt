Congrats on $100M Revenue Capture & Forbes Recognition

Email Body:
Hi Janet,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Axuall's $100M revenue capture and 70% Wallet growth—Forbes-worthy bio-infrastructure.

Hypergrowth strains customer success teams managing 200K+ daily verifications. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Customer Success Automation: Proactively detect issues and route resolutions while maintaining your 99%+ match rate.
- Sales Intelligence: Identify expansion opportunities in your existing healthcare system accounts.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
