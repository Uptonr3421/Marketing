Email Body:
Hi Allison,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Public Theatre securing a $4M Mandel Foundation grant toward your $12M capital campaign.

Managing multiple world premieres while fundraising for major capital projects stretches resources thin. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated Marketing: AI creates personalized email campaigns and social media content for each production automatically.
- Grant Writing Assistant: Streamline grant applications with AI-powered research and proposal drafting.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
