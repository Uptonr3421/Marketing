Hi Cody,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Playhouse Square co-produced The Outsiders which won the 2024 Tony for Best Musical.

Coordinating multiple Broadway productions while optimizing ticket sales across diverse shows is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
