Email Body:
Hi Amy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland achieved record $6.9B visitor spending in 2024.

Managing 300+ conventions and personalizing experiences for 18.6M visitors requires data insights most teams lack. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Visitor Analytics AI: Identifies behavior patterns to personalize recommendations and increase repeat visits.
- Convention Planning Automation: Streamlines booking workflows and logistics coordination for 300+ annual events.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
