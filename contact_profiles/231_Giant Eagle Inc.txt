Email Body:
Hi Aleah,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Giant Eagle's "Because It Matters" strategy with $100M+ investment and delivery expansion to 33 new locations.

Managing inventory and pricing across 211+ stores while expanding delivery is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Demand Forecasting: Optimize inventory across all locations, reducing waste while improving product availability.
- Smart Pricing: Maximize margins while staying competitive on your 300+ price-reduced staples.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
