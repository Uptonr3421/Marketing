Email Body:
Hi Jennifer,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland announced record $6.9B tourist spending in 2024.

Managing 18.6M visitors generates massive inquiry volumes that strain your team. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Visitor Chatbot: Handles 24/7 tourism inquiries with personalized recommendations, reducing staff workload by 60%.
- Predictive Analytics: Forecasts tourism trends and optimizes marketing spend based on real-time booking patterns.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
