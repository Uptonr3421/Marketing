Email Subject:
AI That Adapts to Evolving ATM Threats

Email Body:
Hi Lou,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf pioneered Windows 11 deployment across live ATM networks.

Traditional rule-based fraud systems can't adapt as quickly as criminals evolve their ATM attack methods. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI fraud detection: Machine learning adapts to new attack patterns in real-time, not just known threats.
- Predictive maintenance: Optimizes ATM fleet performance and reduces emergency service costs significantly.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
