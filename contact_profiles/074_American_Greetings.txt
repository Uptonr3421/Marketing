Hi Kyle,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings expanded digital gifting in February with gift cards and custom songs integration.

Digital transformation demands personalization at scale across thousands of designs - manual processes create bottlenecks. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
