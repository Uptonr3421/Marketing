12 Years Serving Foster Youth

Email Body:
Hi Sean,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Fostering Hope's three-pillar model serving foster youth since 2013.

Coordinating donors and volunteers manually limits your impact scale. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Donor Automation: Personalized campaigns and thank-you messages increase retention by 40%.
- Volunteer Matching: AI pairs skills to needs, automates scheduling, reduces coordination time.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
