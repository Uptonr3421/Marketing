CPL's 100th Anniversary - Modernizing Operations

Email Body:
Hi Andrew,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.

With your ambitious 10-year plan to renovate all 27 libraries, coordinating programs and patron services across locations gets complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Smart scheduling: Automatically coordinate programs across all 27 branches, reducing conflicts by 60%
- AI chatbot: Handle routine patron inquiries 24/7, freeing staff for specialized assistance

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
