Email Body:
Hi Monique,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland's record-breaking $6.9B in tourist spending with 18.6M visitors in 2024.

Managing analytics and personalization for millions of visitors is overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated Visitor Analytics: Track visitor patterns and optimize marketing campaigns in real-time without manual data processing.
- AI-Powered Personalization: Deliver targeted destination recommendations to millions of potential visitors automatically.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
