Hi Shawn,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Marigold Catering's exciting 2025 merger expanding into the Akron market.

Managing events across 25+ venue partnerships can create scheduling conflicts and operational headaches. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Intelligent Scheduling: AI-powered calendar management prevents double-bookings and optimizes staff allocation across venues.
- Customer Engagement: Automated personalized communications and menu recommendations based on client preferences and event history.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
