Hi Joshua,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's bold $200M share repurchase program announcement.

With service revenue down 6.7% and product revenue down 19.7%, growth acceleration is critical. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Customer Service: Automate support workflows to improve satisfaction while reducing service costs.
- Process Automation: Eliminate inefficiencies and cut operational expenses by 30-40%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
