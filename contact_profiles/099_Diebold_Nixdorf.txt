Your Kuwait International Bank ITM Success

Email Body:
Hi Terra,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's successful ITM deployment at Kuwait International Bank with video teller features.

Scaling self-service banking across diverse markets means supporting multiple languages and regulations simultaneously. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Chatbots: Multilingual support handling 80% of routine queries, reducing call center costs by $200K annually.
- Process Automation: Streamlines account opening and compliance checks, cutting onboarding time from 45 to 8 minutes.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
