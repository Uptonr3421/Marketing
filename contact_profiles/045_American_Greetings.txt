Hi Nicole,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings closed the Elliott Investment Management acquisition and scored 100 on HRC's LGBTQ+ workplace equality assessment.

Digital transformation while maintaining brand authenticity is delicate. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
