Unifying Your Omnichannel Retail Experience

Email Body:
Hi Sabrina,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' impressive IT modernization partnership driving digital growth.

Omnichannel retail integration often creates data silos and inconsistent customer experiences. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Omnichannel Marketing AI: Unify customer data across retail/e-commerce for personalized campaigns increasing conversion by 28%.
- Predictive Inventory: AI forecasting reduces stockouts by 45% while optimizing retail partner satisfaction.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
