Your Industry-First Recyclable RFID Innovation

Email Body:
Hi Terrie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's June 2025 industry-first APR-recognized recyclable RFID label achievement.

Extracting insights from 30B connected items is overwhelming without AI. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- IoT Analytics: AI surfaces actionable patterns from massive RFID datasets, accelerating R&D cycles.
- Supply Chain Intelligence: Predictive models optimize inventory and forecast demand shifts.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
