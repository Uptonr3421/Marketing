Email Body:
Hi Anna,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed evrecruit.io's rapid growth since launching in 2023, specializing in HR, Finance, and Technology placements.

Manual resume screening steals time from building candidate relationships and client development. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI resume screening: Rank 100+ candidates in minutes by role fit and qualifications
- Automated interview scheduling: Eliminate back-and-forth emails with smart calendar coordination

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
