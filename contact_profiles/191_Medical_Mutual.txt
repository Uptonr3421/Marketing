Email Subject:
Congrats on Paramount Health Acquisition

Email Body:
Hi Teresa,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Medical Mutual's acquisition of Paramount Health—77,000+ new members.

Integrating claims systems post-acquisition creates processing bottlenecks. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Claims Processing Automation: Reduce processing time 60% while eliminating errors during system integration.
- Predictive Retention Analytics: Identify at-risk members from both portfolios to prevent churn during transition.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
