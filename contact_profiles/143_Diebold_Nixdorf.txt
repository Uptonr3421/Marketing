Email Body:
Hi Jessica,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's ATM recycling technology deployed in 800,000 units globally.

Financial technology firms struggle to scale recurring service contracts while competing against fintech disruptors and preventing sophisticated fraud. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Fraud Detection: Real-time transaction analysis flags suspicious activities before they become costly losses.
- Cash Management Optimization: AI forecasts usage patterns to reduce cash-in-transit costs by up to 40%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
