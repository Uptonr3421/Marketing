Email Body:
Hi Erica,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Donovan Mitchell's season-high 46 points and the Cavs' dominant 64-18 record.

Converting playoff momentum into sustained season ticket and merchandise revenue is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
