Enhance your 95% service delivery

Email Body:
Hi Ryan,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your outstanding 95%+ on-time service delivery managing critical Greenfield facility inventory.

Manual scheduling can't anticipate demand volatility—safety stock balloons costs. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Demand Forecasting: Machine learning predicts SKU requirements 6 weeks out, reducing stockouts while cutting safety stock 20%.
- Inventory Optimization: Dynamic reorder points balance service levels against holding costs, protecting your 95%+ delivery rate.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
