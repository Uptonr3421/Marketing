Hi Lisa,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CLAW 25's ambitious lineup of 100+ workshops.

Coordinating complex multi-day event logistics with volunteer teams is overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Engagement Tools: Maximize attendee participation and increase charitable fundraising through smart targeting.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
