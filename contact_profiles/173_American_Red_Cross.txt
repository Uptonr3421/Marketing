Streamlining Your Volunteer Coordination

Email Body:
Hi Miguelina,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Red Cross manages 300,000 volunteers across 64,000+ incidents annually.

Coordinating this massive volunteer workforce in real-time during disasters is overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Volunteer Scheduling: Automate dispatch and resource allocation, reduce coordination time 50%+
- Predictive Analytics: Forecast disaster response needs for better preparedness

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
