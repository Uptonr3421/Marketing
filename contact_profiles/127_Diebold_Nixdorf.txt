Email Body:
Hi Melanie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's strategic focus on leveraging AI and standardizing processes for scalable growth post-restructuring.

Managing operational costs while rolling out AI initiatives is tough. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Workflow Automation: Standardize processes across departments and reduce execution time by 50%.
- Intelligent Analytics: Optimize resource allocation to support 15% adjusted EBITDA margin goals.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
