8 Years Serving Cleveland Wellness

Email Body:
Hi Spencer,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Big Creek Massotherapy has been serving Cleveland's west side wellness community since 2016.

Keeping schedules full while identifying clients who might lapse before they disappear is tough. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Smart scheduling: Reduces no-shows and optimizes therapist time automatically.
- Retention AI: Flags at-risk clients before they stop booking.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
