Email Body:
Hi Suzanne,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's successful shift to 74% recurring revenue model.

Traditional ATM sales face pressure from mobile-first platforms requiring integrated experiences. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Journey Mapping: Connect ATM and digital touchpoints for seamless customer experiences across all channels.
- Banking Chatbots: Automate 60% of routine inquiries with intelligent self-service solutions.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
