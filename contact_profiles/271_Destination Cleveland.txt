Email Body:
Hi Mark,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland achieved record 18.6 million visits and 4% year-over-year growth in 2024.

Measuring ROI and attribution across multiple marketing channels proves challenging at this scale. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered marketing attribution: Track which campaigns drive the highest-value visitors and optimize budget allocation.
- Automated competitive intelligence: Monitor competing destination cities and identify emerging opportunities to maintain Cleveland's leadership.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
