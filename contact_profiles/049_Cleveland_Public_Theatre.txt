Hi Tiffani,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Public Theatre's Cultivate season secured a Mellon Foundation grant as part of the Future of American Theatre Cohort.

Maximizing ticket sales and donor engagement across multiple shows is tough. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Audience targeting AI: Increases ticket sales by identifying likely attendees for each show
- Donor engagement automation: Personalizes outreach and increases recurring donations by 40%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
