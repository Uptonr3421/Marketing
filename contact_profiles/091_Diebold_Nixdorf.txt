Fellow Plexus Member - Scaling Operations

Email Body:
Hi Sarah,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf won multiple 2025 Global Banking & Finance Awards.

Managing 30,000+ users while scaling operations creates significant support bottlenecks. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Service Desk: Automate tier-1 support to reduce call volumes by 40%+ like your recent 30% reduction
- Predictive ATM Analytics: Forecast maintenance needs before failures occur, maximizing uptime

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
