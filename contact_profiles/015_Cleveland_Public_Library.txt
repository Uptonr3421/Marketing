Email Subject:
Scaling CPL's Free Educational Workshops

Email Body:
Hi Meagan,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's free parent-teacher workshops helping families enhance student success.

Scaling these workshops across 27 branches while tracking registration and impact gets overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Workshop automation: Handle registration, reminders, and follow-ups automatically
- Smart matching: Recommend relevant programs to patrons based on their interests and needs

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
