Email Body:
Hi Kelly,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Donovan Mitchell's 46-point performance leading the Cavs to continued success.

How do you maintain fan engagement between seasons and predict which season ticket holders won't renew? I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI renewal predictions: Identify at-risk season ticket accounts 90 days early for proactive outreach.
- Automated re-engagement campaigns: Personalize off-season content based on attendance and purchase history.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
