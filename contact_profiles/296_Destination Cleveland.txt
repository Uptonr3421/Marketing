Hi Caroline,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland's record $6.9B visitor spending in 2024 with 4% year-over-year growth.

Scaling marketing across Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, and DC while maintaining momentum is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Multi-market automation: Personalize Cleveland messaging for each city's audience preferences and travel behaviors.
- Visitor analytics: Identify which attractions drive the highest ROI per market and optimize campaign spend.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
