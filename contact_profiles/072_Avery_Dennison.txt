Reducing waste in Avery Dennison's packaging ops

Email Body:
Hi Bobbi,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison won the 2024 MHI award for sustainability innovation with 49% carbon reduction.

Packaging operations still generate excessive plastic waste despite strong sustainability commitments. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Supply chain optimization AI: Reduces waste and improves sustainability metrics through predictive demand and inventory analytics.
- Predictive quality control: Minimizes manufacturing defects and material waste by catching issues before production.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
