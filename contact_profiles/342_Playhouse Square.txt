Email Body:
Hi Russ,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Playhouse Square launching The Notebook and Hell's Kitchen national tours.

Creating compelling marketing content for multiple premiere launches simultaneously is resource-intensive. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Content AI: Generate engaging show descriptions and promotional materials faster and more consistently.
- Audience Targeting: Match each production with ideal demographic segments to maximize ticket sales.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
