Your Strive Partnership: Finding Hidden CKD Patients

Email Body:
Hi Shanna,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your Strive Health partnership serving 10,000+ kidney disease patients.

Only 150K of 1.3M Ohioans with CKD know they have it—massive underdiagnosis. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive Health Analytics: Analyze claims data to identify undiagnosed CKD patients before they reach crisis stage.
- Member Engagement Automation: Scale proactive outreach to at-risk members without increasing headcount.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
