Email Body:
Hi Darlene,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Therapy Group's mission to empower every client.

Administrative tasks steal time from therapeutic care. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI scheduling: Automate booking and reduce no-shows with intelligent reminders, freeing therapists for client care.
- Automated intake: Streamline onboarding with AI forms that identify urgent cases and reduce paperwork burden.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
