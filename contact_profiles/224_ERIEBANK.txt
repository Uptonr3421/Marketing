Email Body:
Hi Anne,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed ERIEBANK received Smart Culture Honoree recognition in 2025.

Manual loan processing and handling repetitive customer inquiries limits your team's capacity to serve more business clients. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Loan Application Processor: Analyzes business financials automatically and accelerates approval decisions by 50%.
- Customer Service Assistant: Handles routine account inquiries 24/7, freeing your team for complex business banking needs.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
