Hi Theresa,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's 100th anniversary celebration and stunning new MLK Jr. Campus opening.

Managing 27 branches with diverse community needs demands smart resource allocation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-driven resource optimization: Predict book demand and program attendance, maximizing circulation and minimizing waste.
- Intelligent patron chatbot: Answer common questions 24/7, freeing staff for high-value community engagement.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
