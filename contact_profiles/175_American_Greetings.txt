Fellow Plexus Member: Scaling American Greetings' Digital Innovation

Email Body:
Hi Lindsey,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' digital innovation with the Peanuts Advent calendar and Elliott Investment's growth vision.

Managing personalized content across AG Interactive, Blue Mountain, SmashUps, and Creatacard at scale is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Content Engine: Generates personalized greeting card messages across all platforms, reducing production time by 70%.
- Predictive Analytics: Optimizes customer engagement patterns to increase digital conversion rates by 40%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
