Email Body:
Hi Terry,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland is hosting a record 55 cruise ship calls in 2025.

Managing thousands of cruise visitors with limited shore time requires instant, multilingual information delivery. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Itinerary Optimizer: Creates personalized shore excursions maximizing visitor satisfaction and local business engagement.
- Multilingual Info System: Provides instant translations and local insights in 40+ languages.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
