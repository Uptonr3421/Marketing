Hi Tommy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed GCP's successful advocacy creating $100M in new small and minority business opportunities through major development projects.

Tracking policy changes across local, state, and federal levels while coordinating timely member advocacy is overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated policy monitoring: Tracks relevant legislation changes and automatically alerts stakeholders with customized action items.
- AI-powered campaign optimization: Analyzes member networks to identify and mobilize the most influential advocates for each issue.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
