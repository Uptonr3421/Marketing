Streamlining Operations at Diebold Nixdorf

Email Body:
Hi Sam,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's multiple 2025 Global Banking & Finance Awards.

Post-merger complexity often creates manual, time-intensive processes. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Workflow Automation: Eliminate repetitive tasks and reduce processing time by 60%
- Document Processing: Automate compliance documentation and data extraction with 95% accuracy

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
