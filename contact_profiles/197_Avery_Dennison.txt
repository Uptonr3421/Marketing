Email Body:
Hi Tracy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's atma.io RFID platform is revolutionizing supply chain tracking.

With massive data flows from RFID systems, extracting actionable insights becomes challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive Analytics: AI-driven demand forecasting to reduce inventory costs and improve planning accuracy.
- Supply Chain Optimization: Real-time anomaly detection and automated decision-making for logistics efficiency.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
