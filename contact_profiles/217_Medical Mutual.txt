Email Body:
Hi Bob,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Medical Mutual's digital transformation initiatives and Strive Health partnership.

Manual claims processing consumes resources and delays member care. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered claims automation: Reduces processing time by 75% while improving accuracy and member satisfaction.
- Predictive analytics: Identifies high-risk members early for proactive care management and cost reduction.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
