Hi Caroline,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Hyland just announced the 2025 Innovation Award winners at CommunityLIVE.

With 280% platform growth in six months, onboarding new customers quickly gets overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Smart knowledge base: AI instantly answers customer questions, reducing support tickets 50%
- Onboarding automation: Guide new customers through setup with personalized workflows

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
