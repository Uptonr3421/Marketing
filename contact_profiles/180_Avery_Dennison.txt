Accelerating Medical Marketing at Avery Dennison

Email Body:
Hi Miguel,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your Medical Wearable Adhesives Learning Center launch empowering device engineers.

Manual content creation and analysis drain marketing hours from strategic work. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI content generation: Produce technical content, case studies, and campaigns 3x faster while maintaining quality.
- Customer insights analytics: Identify high-value segments and personalize outreach to boost engagement 40%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
