Email Body:
Hi Dominic,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Playhouse Square won a Tony Award as co-producer of The Outsiders.

Managing patron data and personalizing experiences across multiple venues can be overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered customer insights: Analyze patron behavior patterns to optimize show programming and pricing strategies.
- Automated marketing campaigns: Personalize messaging based on attendance history to increase ticket sales and subscriptions.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
