Hi Erica,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' ambitious SAP transformation and Elliott Investment partnership positioning for growth.

Managing data integration across legacy systems during transformation creates bottlenecks. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI data integration: Reduce migration errors by 60% with intelligent mapping
- Workflow automation: Streamline cross-platform processes automatically

As a Plexus member, 20% off.
