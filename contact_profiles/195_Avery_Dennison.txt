Hi Melissa,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's 2024 MHI Award and industry-first recyclable RFID label.

Developing sustainable materials faster than competitors is critical. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- R&D Acceleration AI: Predict successful sustainable material formulations, cutting development cycles 40%.
- Supply Chain Optimization: Real-time RFID intelligence for inventory accuracy and demand forecasting.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
