Scaling Digital Navigator Impact

Email Body:
Hi Natalie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's Digital Navigators providing one-on-one tech assistance.

Scaling personalized support as demand grows stretches staff thin. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Navigator assistant: Handle basic tech questions, escalate complex issues
- Smart knowledge base: Instant answers to common tech problems

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
