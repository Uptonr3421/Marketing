Hi Darby,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Huntington swept 18 Greenwich Excellence Awards for business banking.

With award-winning service comes scaling challenges—keeping client interactions personal gets harder. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI customer insights: Dashboard reveals upsell opportunities and relationship health scores automatically.
- Meeting prep automation: Pulls client history and market trends before every call.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
