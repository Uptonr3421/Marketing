Hi Chelsea,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings achieved a perfect 100 HRC score for workplace equality.

Modernizing IT infrastructure to handle seasonal peaks while maintaining agility is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Marketing automation: AI orchestrates personalized omnichannel campaigns across email, digital, and retail touchpoints, increasing customer lifetime value 25-40%.
- Predictive analytics: Machine learning forecasts seasonal demand patterns and customer behavior, optimizing inventory allocation and reducing stockouts by 30%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?
