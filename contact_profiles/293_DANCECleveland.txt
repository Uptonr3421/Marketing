Hi David,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your 2025-2026 season announcement featuring four incredible modern dance companies.

Arts organizations struggle with audience engagement across multiple performances. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated marketing: Personalize messaging for each performance based on patron preferences and past attendance.
- Predictive analytics: Identify which audiences will attend specific shows and optimize outreach timing.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
