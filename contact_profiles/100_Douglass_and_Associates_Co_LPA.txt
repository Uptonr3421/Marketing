Hi! Fellow Plexus member here. 40+ Years Serving Cleveland Businesses...

40+ Years Serving Cleveland Businesses

Email Body:
Hi Nicole,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Douglass & Associates has served Cleveland businesses since 1983 with creditors rights and estate planning.

Manual document review for wills, trusts, and creditor claims means billable hours get consumed by routine tasks instead of client advisory. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Legal Document Automation: Generates estate planning documents 70% faster with AI-powered templates and clause libraries.
- Contract Analysis AI: Reviews agreements in minutes, flagging risks and non-standard terms with 95% accuracy.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
