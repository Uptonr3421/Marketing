Hi Vikas,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Red Cross Northern Ohio installed 1,500+ smoke alarms in 2024.

Managing a 90% volunteer workforce across the region is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Volunteer automation: Streamline scheduling, communications, and shift management with AI
- Donor engagement: Increase blood donation retention through personalized outreach campaigns

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
