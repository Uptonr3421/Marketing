Hi Ben,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Nestle's impressive 4.3% Q3 growth during major restructuring.

Managing operational efficiency while navigating a 16,000-person workforce reduction is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Supply Chain AI: Reduce waste and streamline manufacturing workflows with intelligent optimization.
- Predictive Analytics: Enhance quality control and production planning with data-driven insights.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Best,
Upton Rand
