Email Body:
Hi Caitlin,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Summer in the Land connected 1,700 interns from 300+ companies in 2024.

Scaling retention programs to match 190K college students with regional jobs while personalizing outreach is impossible manually. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-Powered Talent Matching Engine: Automatically connect graduates with relevant job opportunities based on skills and company needs to increase retention beyond 50%.
- Predictive Retention Analytics: Identify at-risk students likely to leave the region and trigger personalized engagement campaigns.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
