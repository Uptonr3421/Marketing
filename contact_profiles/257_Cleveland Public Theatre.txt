Hi Scott,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPT's record $6M gift and impressive progress toward your $12M campaign goal.

Maintaining donor relationships while identifying new prospects during intensive campaigns is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI donor engagement: Personalize communication at scale and identify high-potential prospects through behavioral analysis.
- Automated grant assistant: Streamline applications with AI-drafted narratives, increasing submission volume and success rates.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
