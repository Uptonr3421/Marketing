Hi Denise,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed PNC's $100M+ AI infrastructure investment and 130,000+ data element ML initiative.

Large banks face legacy integration challenges while maintaining stability during rapid innovation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Process Automation: Eliminate manual tasks in treasury/commercial operations, freeing teams for strategic work.
- Advanced Fraud Detection: Enhance security while reducing false positives that frustrate customers.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
