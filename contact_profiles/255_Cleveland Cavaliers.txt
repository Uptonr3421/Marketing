Email Body:
Hi Claire,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavaliers' historic 64-win season and Donovan Mitchell's exceptional 2025-26 start.

Managing fan engagement for sold-out games requires personalized experiences at scale. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered fan analytics: Personalize game day experiences based on behavior patterns, increasing engagement and season ticket renewals.
- Automated customer service chatbot: Handle ticketing inquiries 24/7, reducing wait times during peak demand.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
