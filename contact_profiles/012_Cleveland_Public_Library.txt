5-Star Library Meets AI-Powered Archives

Email Body:
Hi Julie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's earned 5-star ratings from Library Journal every year since 2009.

Maintaining that excellence while digitizing historical collections takes massive staff hours. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Document AI: Process and digitize archives 10x faster with automatic quality checks
- Smart metadata: Auto-tag collections for easy patron discovery and research

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
