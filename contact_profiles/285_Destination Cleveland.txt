Hi Mirta,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland hit a record $6.9B in tourist spending in 2024.

Managing 18.6M annual visitor interactions while extracting actionable insights is overwhelming without automation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-Powered Visitor Analytics Dashboard: Automatically analyze visitor spending patterns and demographics to identify high-value tourism segments and optimize marketing ROI.
