Email Body:
Hi Spencer,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Big Creek Massotherapy's established reputation since 2016 in Parma.

Client retention and personalized service drive wellness practice growth but drain time from hands-on care. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Smart scheduling AI: Automated appointments with personalized client reminders reducing no-shows
- Marketing automation: Social media content for wellness tips boosting engagement

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
