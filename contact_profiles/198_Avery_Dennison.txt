Strong growth to $8.8B - scaling challenges?

Email Body:
Hi Rob,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's impressive 4.7% sales growth to $8.8 billion in 2024.

Rapid growth often strains operational systems and resources. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Process Automation: Streamline repetitive workflows, reducing operational costs by up to 40%.
- Intelligent Resource Allocation: AI-powered scheduling and capacity planning to maximize efficiency across facilities.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
