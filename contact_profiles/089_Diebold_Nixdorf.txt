Predictive Maintenance for Banking Tech

Email Body:
Hi David,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's shift to predictive ATM maintenance with AI.

Reactive maintenance creates unexpected downtime hurting customer experience. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive Analytics: Analyzes usage patterns identifying potential failures 2-3 weeks early, scheduling maintenance during off-peak hours
- Service Documentation AI: Automates technician reporting, reducing administrative time 50%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
