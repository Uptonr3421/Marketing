7th Year as #1 SBA Lender

Email Body:
Hi Jazmine,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Huntington hit #1 SBA 7(a) lender for the seventh consecutive year.

Being top lender means processing massive application volume without sacrificing quality. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Document AI: Extracts key application data in seconds instead of hours.
- Risk automation: Flags potential issues before manual review starts.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
