Email Body:
Hi Tori,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed GCP's impressive work on the All In Plan and hosting 1,000+ leaders at your 2025 Annual Event.

Managing 12,000+ member relationships and personalized engagement at scale is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered CRM automation: Delivers personalized member communications automatically based on engagement patterns and preferences.
- Predictive analytics: Identifies at-risk members early and recommends targeted retention strategies.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
