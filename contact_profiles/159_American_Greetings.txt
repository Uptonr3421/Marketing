Helping American Greetings Win Digital

Email Body:
Hi Paige,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' digital gifting expansion with Songfinch and Birdie partnerships.

With the greeting card market declining 4-16% due to digital substitution, capturing younger demographics is critical. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered customer experience optimization: Personalized recommendation engines increase conversion 35-50% by predicting which cards/gifts resonate with each customer segment.
- Predictive analytics for seasonal demand: Machine learning forecasts peak periods, optimizing inventory and reducing waste by 20-30%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
