Email Body:
Hi Cindy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavaliers secured a WNBA expansion team and extended President Koby Altman through 2029-30.

Operating above the second tax apron while expanding requires revenue optimization. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Fan experience personalization: Increases season ticket renewals by 25% through targeted engagement
- Revenue optimization analytics: Identifies untapped sponsorship and merchandising opportunities

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
