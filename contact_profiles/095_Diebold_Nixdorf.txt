Hi Diane,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your impressive $980M backlog and 10% order growth.

Manual processes create bottlenecks when scaling order fulfillment and backlog management. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Intelligent Process Automation: Streamline order processing, documentation, and workflow routing, reducing cycle time 50%+
- AI Demand Forecasting: Predict order volumes and resource needs to optimize fulfillment capacity

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
