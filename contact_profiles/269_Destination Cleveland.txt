Hi Amber,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland drove record $6.9 billion in spending, with 300+ conventions booked in 2024.

Creating personalized content at scale for diverse visitor segments strains your team. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated content generation for campaigns: Produce engaging social media posts, email campaigns, and website copy 10x faster.
- AI-driven audience segmentation: Identify and target high-converting visitor personas from your 18.6M annual visits.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
