Hi Kellee,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL's Kid's Cafe partnership with Greater Cleveland Food Bank.

Coordinating multiple partnerships across 27 branches creates scheduling complexity. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Workflow automation: Streamline partner communications, reduce coordination time
- Smart scheduling: Optimize program times across locations

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
