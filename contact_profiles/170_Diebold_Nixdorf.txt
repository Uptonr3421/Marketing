Email Body:
Hi Lisa,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's strategic headquarters move to North Canton.

Consolidating 600 employees under one roof creates onboarding and knowledge transfer challenges. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Training Automation: Accelerates onboarding, reduces training time by 50%
- Workforce Analytics: Identifies skill gaps, optimizes team performance

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
