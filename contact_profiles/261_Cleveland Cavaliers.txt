Email Body:
Hi Kim,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavs clinching the Central Division title without LeBron for the first time since 1976.

How do you convert championship buzz into long-term season ticket renewals and maximize per-fan spending? I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
