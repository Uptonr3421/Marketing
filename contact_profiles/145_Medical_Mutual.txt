Email Body:
Hi Mindy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Medical Mutual's partnership with Cohere Health for touchless prior authorization.

Health insurers struggle with manual claims processing and prior authorization denials that frustrate providers and create operational bottlenecks. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Claims Automation: Touchless end-to-end processing with real-time approvals reduces administrative burden and speeds payments.
- Member Engagement Chatbots: Reduce call center volume by 40% while improving member satisfaction scores.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
