Hi Jonathon,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Huntington's $7.4B Cadence acquisition creating a top-10 bank with $276B in assets.

Managing operations across an expanded footprint while maintaining exceptional customer service is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
