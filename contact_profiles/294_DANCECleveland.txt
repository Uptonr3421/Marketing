Email Body:
Hi Tanja,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your Community Dance Day with 12 free classes and the Northeast Ohio Student Showcase.

Managing complex community events with multiple classes and student registrations can be overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Event automation: Streamline registration, check-ins, and capacity tracking across all classes.
- Student analytics: Measure participation trends and identify which programs drive the most engagement.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
