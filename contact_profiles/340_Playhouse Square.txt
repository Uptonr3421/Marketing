Email Body:
Hi Noah,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Playhouse Square's Tony Award win for The Outsiders.

Managing personalized engagement for 44,000+ season ticket holders across diverse productions is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- CRM Automation: Personalize communications and show recommendations for each subscriber automatically.
- Smart Email Campaigns: Increase renewal rates and identify upsell opportunities with AI targeting.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
