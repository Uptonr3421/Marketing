26 Years of Community Impact

Email Body:
Hi Erica,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavaliers Foundation has invested $26M in Northeast Ohio since 1993.

Tracking real community impact and optimizing which programs deliver best outcomes is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Impact AI: Quantifies social outcomes across all foundation programs automatically.
- Grant automation: Streamlines application review and fund distribution processes.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
