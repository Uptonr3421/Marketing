Congrats on 2025 Banking Tech Awards

Email Body:
Hi Ryan,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf won multiple 2025 Global Banking & Finance Awards for ATM Services.

Managing thousands of ATMs across multiple regions means downtime costs add up fast. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive Maintenance AI: Reduces ATM downtime by 40% through early failure detection and automated parts ordering.
- Automated Incident Resolution: Cuts response time by 60% with AI-powered diagnostics and remote troubleshooting.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
