Email Body:
Hi Renee,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Lady Luck's feature in Cleveland Magazine as a woman- and queer-owned studio.

Creative agencies lose billable hours on manual client onboarding and workflow coordination. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated Onboarding: Handles contracts and briefs in minutes, not hours.
- Workflow Optimizer: Tracks deliverables automatically, reducing project management time by 40%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
