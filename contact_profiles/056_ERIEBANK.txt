Email Body:
Hi Mona,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed ERIEBANK's first Cuyahoga County branch opening in 2022 and aggressive Cleveland expansion.

Growing branches while maintaining personalized service is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Customer Service: 24/7 intelligent support maintains your community banking touch while scaling.
- Predictive Analytics: Identify cross-sell opportunities and at-risk customers before competitors.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
