Email Body:
Hi Mariah,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed you co-founded Upcycle Parts Shop and built Declutter with Devon with your social work expertise.

Managing multiple client appointments and personalized follow-ups can eat into your organizing time. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Scheduling Assistant: Automatically books appointments, sends reminders, and reduces no-shows by 40%.
- Smart Communication System: Personalizes client follow-ups based on organizing milestones without manual effort.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
