Email Body:
Hi Ky,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed your Resistance Fair drew 1,500 attendees.

Scaling advocacy impact with limited nonprofit resources means every volunteer hour matters. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Volunteer management automation: Match volunteers to tasks based on skills and availability, maximizing impact.
- Campaign targeting optimization: AI-driven voter and donor identification to focus resources where they matter most.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
