Hi CJ,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed PNC deployed $85.5 billion toward your Community Benefits Plan—97% completion is remarkable.

With PNC exploring predictive analytics for treasury management, many banks face a 33% skills gap in AI implementation. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
