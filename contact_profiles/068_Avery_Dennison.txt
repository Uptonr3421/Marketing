Hi Leon,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's $8.8B revenue growth and Optica platform launch.

Only 4.4% of tech budgets address supply chain sustainability despite it driving 28.9% of impact. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
