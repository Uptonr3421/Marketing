Your Packaging Circularity Research Impressed Me

Email Body:
Hi Amanda,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Avery Dennison's April white paper on packaging circularity from your Mentor facility.

Meeting net-zero by 2050 means tracking emissions data across every facility and supplier. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Carbon analytics: Real-time tracking of emissions across your entire supply chain
- Compliance automation: Generate sustainability reports for stakeholders in minutes

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
