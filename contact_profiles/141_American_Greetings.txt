Hi Yamatzy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' innovative Peanuts Digital Advent Calendar launch.

Many greeting card companies struggle to balance physical products with digital transformation while maintaining emotional customer connections. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Customer Sentiment Analysis: Understand emotional connections across physical and digital channels to drive product strategy.
- Predictive Analytics: Forecast trends and optimize inventory based on real-time consumer behavior patterns.

Best,
