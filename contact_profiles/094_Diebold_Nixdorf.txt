Fellow Plexus Member - ATM Operations

Email Body:
Hi Timothy,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow.

ATM downtime creates customer frustration and costly emergency service calls. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive ATM Maintenance: AI forecasts component failures 3-5 days ahead, preventing 80%+ of unplanned downtime
- Smart Service Dispatch: Automatically route technicians with right parts and skills, reducing response time 40%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
