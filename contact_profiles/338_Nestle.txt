Email Body:
Hi Brianna,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Nestlé achieved zero waste at all manufacturing facilities.

Maintaining production efficiency and quality control at scale requires constant vigilance. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive maintenance AI: Prevent equipment failures before they happen, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.
- Computer vision quality control: Detect defects in real-time on production lines to reduce waste.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
