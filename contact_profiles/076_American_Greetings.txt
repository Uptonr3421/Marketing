Boosting Digital Conversion at American Greetings

Email Body:
Hi Grace,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed American Greetings' digital expansion with Virgin Experience Gifts and Songfinch partnerships.

Converting digital browsers into buyers requires sophisticated personalization. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- E-commerce Optimization: AI-powered testing and personalization to increase online conversion rates and average order value.
- Marketing Automation: Intelligent customer segmentation and personalized campaigns that drive engagement and repeat purchases.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
