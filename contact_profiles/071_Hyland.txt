Hi Alexandra,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Hyland's July launch of Knowledge Enrichment to fuel Agentic AI.

- AI-powered workflow automation: Streamlines document processing operations reducing manual work by 60%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
