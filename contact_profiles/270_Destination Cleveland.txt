Email Body:
Hi Brittany,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland booked 300+ conventions bringing $200 million and 208,000 attendees in 2024.

Coordinating logistics and communications for 300+ annual events overwhelms even the best teams. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI event coordination assistants: Automate scheduling, vendor management, and real-time updates for seamless convention execution.
- Automated attendee engagement tools: Personalize pre-event communications and maximize post-event follow-up conversion.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
