Hi Elise,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's impressive 7 consecutive quarters of margin expansion.

Despite this operational progress, revenue challenges persist with Q2 down 2.6%. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Workflow Automation: Streamline operations to reduce costs by 25-40% while maintaining margin gains.
- Predictive Analytics: Optimize supply chain and demand forecasting to address revenue headwinds.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
