27 Branches Need Smart Allocation

Email Body:
Hi Holly,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed CPL managing 27 branch libraries across Cleveland.

Allocating staff, materials, and budgets fairly across diverse neighborhoods is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Resource optimization: AI predicts branch needs, maximizes impact
- Demand forecasting: Anticipate collection and program demands by location

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
