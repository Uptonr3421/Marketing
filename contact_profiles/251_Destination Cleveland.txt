Hi Heidi,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland achieved record $6.9B tourist spending in 2024 with 4% growth.

Managing 18.6M visitors and 300+ annual conventions requires sophisticated data systems. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered visitor analytics: Segment and target high-value tourists to maximize ROI on marketing campaigns
- Automated CRM systems: Streamline convention booking workflows and increase conversion rates

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
