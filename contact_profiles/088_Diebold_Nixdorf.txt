Hi Tina,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold's Oracle AI-powered cloud transformation this August.

Coordinating global service operations can create costly inefficiencies. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Service Orchestration AI: Optimizes field technician routing and scheduling, improving productivity 40%
- Predictive Maintenance: Identifies ATM component failures before occurrence, reducing emergency calls 55%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
