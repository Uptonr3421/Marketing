Hi Jonathan,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf became the first ATM provider to deploy Windows 11 in 2024.

ATM fraud surged 60% in five years, with 10% of consumers experiencing breaches. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI-powered fraud detection: Catches unknown fraud patterns that traditional rule-based systems miss entirely.
- Predictive maintenance: Reduces ATM downtime and extends fleet lifespan with proactive alerts.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
