Email Body:
Hi Heidi,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Douglass & Associates earned the Distinguished award in 2023.

Manual client intake and time-tracking for billing creates administrative bottlenecks that delay revenue and strategy work. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Client Intake Automation: Captures case details, conflicts checks, and generates engagement letters in one workflow.
- Smart Billing Assistant: Tracks billable time automatically and generates accurate invoices, reducing billing errors by 75%.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
