Optimize Diebold's service delivery operations

Email Body:
Hi Tara,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's impressive 90-basis-point service margin improvement in Q1 2025.

Service operations still face manual inefficiencies—you're leaving margin on the table. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive Maintenance: Anticipate ATM failures before they occur, reducing emergency service calls by 30%.
- Service Optimization: AI-powered technician routing cuts travel time 25%, boosting same-day resolution rates.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
