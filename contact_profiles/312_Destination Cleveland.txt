Hi Carrie,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Destination Cleveland achieved a 92% local recommendation rate.

Converting visitor data into personalized experiences that maintain this momentum requires sophisticated analytics most teams lack. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Tourism Recommendation AI: Analyzes preferences to generate personalized itineraries that increase visitor satisfaction and spending.
- Social Media Automation: Creates engaging content showcasing Cleveland's appeal to maintain your impressive recommendation growth.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
