Email Body:
Hi Meranda,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Giant Eagle's ambitious $100M "Because It Matters" growth plan and 60+ pharmacy renovations.

Personalizing experiences across 211+ stores while managing supply chain efficiency is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Personalization Engine: Analyze shopping patterns to deliver targeted promotions that drive loyalty and basket size.
- Supply Chain AI: Optimize logistics to reduce waste and improve freshness across all stores.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
