Hi Ruby,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed GCP's 2025 Sustainability Summit drew 500+ registrations.

Coordinating events and member communications at this scale can overwhelm even the best teams. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
