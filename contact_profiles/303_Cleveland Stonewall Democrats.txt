Hi Nautica,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Stonewall Democrats sponsored Resistance Fair 2025 and joined the National Federation.

Coordinating volunteers and engaging members for advocacy events requires constant manual communication. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Volunteer Scheduler: Automates shift assignments with SMS reminders, reducing no-shows by 40%.
- Social Media AI: Generates advocacy content optimized for engagement and reach.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
