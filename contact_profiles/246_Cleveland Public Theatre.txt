Email Body:
Hi Amanda,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Public Theatre's $6M transformative gift—now over halfway to your $12M capital campaign goal.

Tracking impact across 1,000+ youth in programs like Cleveland Act Now and STEP is challenging. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Automated impact reporting: Measures program outcomes across all initiatives in real-time
- Donor engagement automation: Personalizes outreach and increases recurring donations by 40%

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
