Hi Madison,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Playhouse Square won its first-ever Tony Award for The Outsiders.

Launching two national tours this season means managing complex schedules and scaling audience engagement. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
