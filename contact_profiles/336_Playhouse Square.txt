Hi Jennifer,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed you're launching national tours of The Notebook and Hell's Kitchen.

Coordinating multiple tour launches while maximizing audience engagement is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive analytics: Forecast ticket demand patterns to optimize scheduling and pricing across tour dates.
- AI chatbots: Provide 24/7 patron service with personalized show recommendations that boost conversion rates.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
