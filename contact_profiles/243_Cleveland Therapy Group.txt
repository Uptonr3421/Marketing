Hi Christina,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Cleveland Therapy Group's dedication to providing welcoming, empowering mental health services.

Administrative overhead—documentation, scheduling, insurance verification—reduces time available for clinical work. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
