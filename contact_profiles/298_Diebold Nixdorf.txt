Email Body:
Hi Donald,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf winning multiple 2025 Global Banking & Finance Awards for ATM Services.

Scaling service operations across thousands of global ATMs while maintaining uptime is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Predictive Maintenance: AI forecasts equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and emergency service costs.
- Automated Operations: Streamline service ticket routing and technician scheduling across your global network.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
