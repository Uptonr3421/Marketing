Email Body:
Hi Adam,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed the Cavaliers achieved a 56% viewership increase—highest ratings since 2017-18.

Managing fan engagement data across digital platforms, social media, and in-stadium experiences is complex. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Fan Engagement AI: Personalize content and predict fan behavior across all touchpoints.
- Social Media Automation: Optimize posting times and content to maximize engagement rates.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
