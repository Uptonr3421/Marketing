Hi Casey,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed GCP created nearly $100M in new small and minority business opportunities in 2024.

Tracking impact metrics and compliance across dozens of programs while demonstrating ROI to stakeholders requires constant manual reporting. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.
