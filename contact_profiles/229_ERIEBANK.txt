Hi Karen,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed ERIEBANK's Smart Culture award and expansion into underserved Cleveland communities.

Regional banks often struggle integrating customer data across branches while competing with larger institutions. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Customer Insights: Personalize services and identify cross-sell opportunities automatically across all branches.
- Compliance Automation: Reduce regulatory review time and risk with intelligent monitoring.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
