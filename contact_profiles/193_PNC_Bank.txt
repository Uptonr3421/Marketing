Email Body:
Hi Mrs. Grace,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed PNC's mobile branch program serving underserved Cleveland communities.

6% deposit shrinkage in Northeast Ohio threatens growth. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Customer Retention AI: Predict at-risk depositors and personalize engagement to prevent attrition.
- Financial Education Chatbot: Scale your CFE program 24/7 without additional staff costs.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
