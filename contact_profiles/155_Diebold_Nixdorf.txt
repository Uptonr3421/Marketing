Fellow Plexus Member - Congrats on Banking Awards

Email Body:
Hi Jen,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Diebold Nixdorf's 2025 Global Banking & Finance Awards for ATM Services.

Managing customer support across thousands of ATM touchpoints can strain resources. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Customer Support Chatbot: Automates tier-1 support queries 24/7, reducing response time by 80%.
- Predictive Analytics: Forecasts equipment maintenance needs, minimizing downtime and service costs.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
