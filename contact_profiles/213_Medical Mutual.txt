Email Body:
Hi Tatum,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Medical Mutual's commitment to serving Ohio healthcare needs for over 90 years.

With AI-driven claims from providers cutting into insurer profits, automated verification is critical. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- Intelligent Claims Automation: Reduce processing costs 40% while improving accuracy and transparency.
- Predictive Member Analytics: Identify high-risk members early to enable proactive care coordination.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
