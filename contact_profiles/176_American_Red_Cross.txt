Fellow Plexus Member: Optimizing Red Cross Emergency Response

Email Body:
Hi Kimberly,

As a fellow Plexus member, I noticed Northern Ohio Red Cross responded to 1,000+ fires, providing $1.1M in aid to residents.

Coordinating volunteers for 3 home fires daily while managing emergency response at scale is overwhelming. I started my first business in Cleveland, founded Bespoke Ethos to help owners like you. Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified.

- AI Volunteer Scheduler: Optimizes deployment based on skills, location, and availability, reducing response time by 35%.
- Predictive Analytics: Forecasts resource needs for proactive disaster response and efficient allocation.

As a Plexus member, 20% off.

Would you be free for a 15 min call next week?

Best,
Upton Rand
Founder
