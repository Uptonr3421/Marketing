=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on winning "Best Record Art" at the Making Vinyl global industry conference for the Cleveland artists compilation "Double Trouble" - bringing international recognition to Cleveland's music scene!

Acknowledge the remarkable entrepreneurial journey: started experimenting with vinyl scraps in 2010 out of curiosity, turned it into custom pressing business (2012), launched record label (2015), formed official partnership (2018). That evolution shows real vision and hustle.

Reference his mission to "empower local artists" and how he's created something unique in the world - custom vinyl art that personifies the artist and music. Mention how powerful it is that a Cleveland native from a musical family is elevating local musicians through innovative vinyl pressing.

Acknowledge the challenge of educating independent artists about custom vinyl possibilities, especially reaching musicians who don't know these services exist or think custom vinyl is too expensive. Share how his work represents the opposite of mass-produced corporate music - unique art for unique artists.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help Cleveland musicians and national independent artists discover Wax Mage's custom vinyl services. Mention potential connections to local music venues, arts organizations, and LGBTQ+ musicians.

Position as supporting a fellow Cleveland creative entrepreneur who's putting the city's innovation on the global map while lifting up local artists.
