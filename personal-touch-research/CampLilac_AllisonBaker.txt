FOUNDERS' STORY & BACKGROUND
===========================================
In summer 2016, two Cleveland-area families had a shared experience: Ann Williams' transgender grandson and JodiLyn Solomon's transgender daughter each came home from overnight camp wishing there was a camp specifically for trans teens.

At a trans family support group meeting in Cleveland, Ann stood up and asked if anyone was interested in creating such a camp. JodiLyn immediately raised her hand. They connected through that support group and decided to make their kids' dream a reality.

Ann and JodiLyn were soon joined by JodiLyn's child AJ (now an adult and former camper). Papers were filed, and under GenderSphere as the parent organization, Camp Lilac was incorporated in January 2017.

Lead with the founding story - two moms at a Cleveland support group whose trans kids came home from camp wishing for a place where they could be themselves. This is the definition of grassroots, parent-driven community building. It's personal, powerful, and deeply moving.

Reference the explosive growth from 16 campers in 2017 to 150+ in 2023 - this shows both the urgent need and the impact Camp Lilac is having. Acknowledge JodiLyn Solomon's recognition as a 2020 Difference Maker and Most Interesting Person - show you know the leaders.

Mention the connection to Jewish values and tikkun olam - if reaching out to JodiLyn specifically, this shows understanding of what drives her. Reference Plexus membership as shared community connection.

Acknowledge the challenging climate for trans youth and the critical importance of Camp Lilac's work providing safety, joy, and community for some of the most vulnerable young people.

Position marketing/branding services as support for:
- Expanding reach to families who desperately need Camp Lilac
- Fundraising campaigns for scholarships and training fund
- Building awareness without compromising safety/privacy
- Donor cultivation and stewardship communications
- Email marketing to past families, supporters, allies
- Content strategy for sharing impact stories (with permission)
- Website optimization for enrollment and donations
- Social media strategy that balances visibility with safety
- PR for JodiLyn as thought leader on trans youth wellbeing
- Annual report and impact materials for foundations
- Building planned giving/endowment program

Tone: Respectful, mission-driven, understanding of sensitivity. Acknowledge this isn't just a camp - it's literally life-saving work for trans youth who often face rejection, isolation, and danger. Position as partner who wants to amplify their critical work while maintaining safety and values.

IMPACT & IMPORTANCE
===========================================
For context on why Camp Lilac matters:

Transgender youth face:
- Higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicide attempts
- Family rejection (40% of homeless youth are LGBTQ+)
- School bullying and harassment
- Isolation from peers who understand them
- Few safe spaces to be authentic selves

Camp Lilac provides:
- Week where gender diversity is the norm, not exception
- Peer community of other trans/gender diverse teens
- Affirmation and validation of identity
- Traditional camp joy without fear of misgendering or rejection
- Lifelong friendships and chosen family
- Respite for both campers and parents
- Hope and resilience to face challenging school year

This is transformative, often life-saving work disguised as "summer camp." The impact ripples through families, schools, and communities as campers return more confident and resilient.

===========================================
FUNDRAISING PRIORITIES
===========================================
Based on GiveLively presence, two main funds:
1. Camp Lilac Scholarship Fund - ensuring access regardless of family financial situation
2. Camp Lilac Training Fund - training staff to provide highest quality, safest, most affirming environment

Both critical to mission delivery and growth.
