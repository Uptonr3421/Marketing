=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on the recent trifecta of ballot wins - Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, Orange land-use campaign, and Lorain County Sheriff primary, all at approximately 60%! That's remarkable success and demonstrates real strategic expertise.

Acknowledge Brian's impressive credentials: 26+ years of experience, education from Kent State, Eastern, and Harvard (Disruptive Strategy certificate). Reference his reputation for "transforming seemingly impossible situations into success" - that's powerful.

Point out that WrightPath's expertise in strategic communications, crisis management, and advocacy likely translates beyond political campaigns to nonprofits and businesses facing communications challenges. Many organizations need exactly those skills but might not think to reach out to a political consulting firm.

Mention the challenge of project-based political work and potential value in diversifying into nonprofit advocacy, land use consulting, and crisis communications for businesses. Share how your work with Plexus and LGBTQ+ organizations connects you with nonprofits that need advocacy expertise.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help position WrightPath's crisis communications and advocacy skills to nonprofit and business audiences beyond political campaigns. Offer to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.

Position as supporting a fellow Cleveland communications professional who's winning important progressive victories while potentially expanding impact beyond election cycles.
