=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open as a fellow Plexus member reaching out to someone with impressive Cleveland corporate credentials - 12+ years at American Greetings and coaching experience at Key Bank. Those are major Cleveland institutions!

Acknowledge her unique "uplifting encourager" philosophy and positive psychology approach to HR. Point out how refreshing that is compared to traditional compliance-focused, punitive HR. Her belief that people need to know they "belong, are enough & matter" is beautiful and probably resonates deeply with LGBTQ+ organizations.

Reference the Fractional HR Leadership model and acknowledge the challenge of educating small businesses and nonprofits that they can access experienced HR expertise (with American Greetings and Key Bank background!) without hiring full-time.

Mention how her diversity and inclusion expertise is particularly valuable for Plexus member organizations wanting HR support from someone who understands LGBTQ+ workplace dynamics.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help small businesses and nonprofits discover her positive psychology HR approach and Fractional HR Leadership services. Share how many organizations need exactly her uplifting, encouraging style but might not know it exists as alternative to traditional HR.

Position as one Plexus member supporting another, both committed to helping organizations create environments where people belong and thrive (she through HR, you through authentic marketing).
