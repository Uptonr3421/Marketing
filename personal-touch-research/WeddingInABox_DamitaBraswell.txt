Open as a fellow Plexus member reaching out about her unique dual service offering - both wedding officiant AND full planning/decor services. That comprehensive approach is perfect for couples planning micro-weddings and intimate ceremonies who want a cohesive, personal experience.

Acknowledge her non-denominational officiant work and how important that is for couples who don't want religious ceremony but still want meaningful, spiritual celebration. For LGBTQ+ couples especially, finding affirming officiants who will celebrate their love authentically is crucial.

Reference her focus on creating "personal and truly original weddings" based on couples' personalities - so different from cookie-cutter wedding industry. Mention the challenge of reaching couples who value that originality vs. following Pinterest trends.

Share how many Plexus members and LGBTQ+ couples are looking for exactly her services but might not know where to find inclusive, non-denominational officiants who also offer planning/decor.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help LGBTQ+ and diverse couples discover her affirming services. Offer to discuss showcasing the classes she offers and wedding gallery.
