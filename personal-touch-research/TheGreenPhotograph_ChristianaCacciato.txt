=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on the incredible growth - nearly 200 clients when she targeted 100 in year 2! Acknowledge what a remarkable achievement that is, especially after reinventing her business in a new market.

Reference her unique mission of respecting melanin and proper color-theory in commercial photography - point out how rare and valuable this expertise is, and how many businesses don't even realize their brand photos aren't properly representing their team's diverse skin tones.

Mention her Torchbearers Akron recognition and Bounce Innovation Hub partnership. Acknowledge the challenge of communicating highly technical expertise (color theory) in a way that helps potential clients understand why it matters for their brand.

Offer to discuss how strategic marketing could help POC and women-owned businesses discover her specialized services. Share ideas about showcasing before/after examples or educating market about melanin-respectful photography.

Position as supporting a fellow woman entrepreneur who's making representation and equity real through her craft, not just talking about it.
