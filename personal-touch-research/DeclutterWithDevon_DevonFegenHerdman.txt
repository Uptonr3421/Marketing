BUSINESS DESCRIPTION:
Declutter with Devon LLC is a professional organizing business providing hands-on organizing assistance to help clients find more ease at home. Devon specializes in decluttering, simplifying, and organizing living spaces by removing unnecessary items and creating more functional and aesthetically pleasing environments. The business was founded in 2022 and takes a caring, nonjudgmental approach to helping clients.

FOUNDER BACKGROUND:
Devon Fegen-Herdman graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 2005 with a Master's Degree in Social Work and has been a licensed social worker for over 17 years. She worked at Hospice of the Western Reserve for many years meeting with clients in hospitals to complete admissions, and was an advanced certified hospice and palliative care social worker from 2010-2016. In 2022, she brought her passion and career experience together by founding Declutter with Devon LLC. While professional organizing is not provided under her social work license, she considers it "social work adjacent" and her background provides extensive training and experience in working with others, assisting with emotions, and making home visits.

SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH:
Lead with recognition of her incredible career transition - bringing 17+ years of social work experience to professional organizing. Acknowledge that her hospice social work background gives her unique understanding of life transitions, grief, and the emotional aspects of decluttering that most organizers don't have.

Highlight that she founded the business in 2022, showing entrepreneurial courage after a long social work career. Reference her Case Western education and Plexus membership as evidence of her Cleveland community connections.

Emphasize the challenge of marketing organizing services to people who often feel shame about clutter. Her caring, nonjudgmental approach (informed by social work training) is her competitive advantage - but potential clients need to know about it.

Offer strategic marketing support to help her reach more Cleveland-area clients who would benefit from her unique trauma-informed, compassionate organizing services.

Connect through Plexus community and shared values around compassionate, nonjudgmental service.
