• Building awareness in Cleveland market from Cincinnati base

• Values personalized counsel over transactional consulting

=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
**RECOMMENDATION: Carefully consider if Cincinnati-based consultant is right fit for Cleveland-focused outreach.**

If proceeding: Open as a fellow Plexus member acknowledging Jim's extraordinary 41+ years as nonprofit consultant and the company's 29-year track record. Congratulate on Jody's 24 years with the firm - that retention speaks volumes about culture and values.

Reference the comprehensive nonprofit experience "from Arts groups to Zoos" and the multi-perspective approach Jim brings. Acknowledge that personalized nonprofit counsel is exactly what organizations need but hard to find.

NOTE geographic consideration: The Yunker Group is Cincinnati-based, which may present challenges serving Cleveland market. However, their Plexus membership suggests openness to Cleveland connections.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help build awareness among Cleveland/Northeast Ohio nonprofits who need executive search, fundraising counsel, and strategic planning. Share Plexus nonprofit connections.

Position as one Plexus member supporting another, with caveat about geographic distance between Cincinnati and Cleveland.

**IMPORTANT: Verify if this Cincinnati-based firm actively seeks Cleveland clients before prioritizing outreach.**
