=== PAIN POINTS ===
• BRAND NEW business (opened Nov 1, 2024) - building awareness from scratch

• Driving attendance to events in startup phase when building audience
• Balancing multiple revenue streams: consulting, immersive experiences, community events
• Competing for attention in crowded Cleveland events/workshops market
• Marketing to diverse audiences (artists, professionals, wellness seekers, performing arts lovers)
• Building credibility and trust as new business
• Filling event calendar consistently while still establishing brand
• Lakewood location may be off beaten path for downtown Cleveland audiences

• Shared commitment to community and connection over transaction
• Plexus member - LGBTQ+ business community connection
• Values creativity and personal growth aligned with authentic marketing
• Lakewood/Detroit Shoreway area - local Cleveland west side
• Entrepreneurial spirit - empowering "visionary leaders and problem solvers"

=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on opening WovenSmart November 1, 2024 - literally just launched! Acknowledge what an exciting and nerve-wracking time it is to open a new business and start building awareness from scratch.

Reference the unique concept of blending creativity, mindfulness, and performing arts through an "Experience Studio" - that's a beautiful vision but probably challenging to explain in a sound bite. Mention the Valerian Ruminski opera concert and diverse workshop offerings (Chair Makeover, art classes, meditation, networking).

Acknowledge as a fellow Plexus member and point out the challenge of building audience for a brand new venture, especially one that doesn't fit neatly into existing categories (not just a workshop space, not just a performance venue, not just a consulting firm - all three!).

Share that the mission to empower visionary leaders and problem solvers through creativity and connection is powerful, but may need strategic messaging to help Lakewood and Cleveland communities understand what WovenSmart offers.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help build awareness for this beautiful new venture in its critical launch phase. Offer to brainstorm how to communicate the Experience Studio concept and drive event attendance.

Position as one entrepreneur supporting another at the most challenging stage - startup - and as a fellow Plexus member committed to helping LGBTQ+ and allied businesses succeed.
