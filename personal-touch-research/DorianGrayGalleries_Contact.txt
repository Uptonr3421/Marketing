BUSINESS DESCRIPTION:
Dorian Gray Galleries is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit online art gallery that was developed to help bring awareness, funding, and resources to homeless LGBTQ+ youth in Northeast Ohio. The organization houses donated art for sale, with 100% of donations going directly to those affected or at-risk in the LGBTQ+ community. Dorian Gray Galleries works in conjunction with The Dorian Gray Youth Foundation to provide funding and resources to housing insecure LGBTQ+ youth (ages 12-24) in Northeast Ohio. The organization operates as an online platform where donated artwork is sold or auctioned.

ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND:

The galleries project was an annual initiative for 2022 that consisted of taking in donated art from all over the country and auctioning it off regularly. The organization serves as a crucial resource for one of the most vulnerable populations - LGBTQ+ youth experiencing housing insecurity.

SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH:
Lead with deep appreciation for their mission - addressing LGBTQ+ youth homelessness through art is both creative and crucial. Acknowledge that LGBTQ+ youth are disproportionately impacted by homelessness and housing insecurity, making this work life-saving.

Highlight the brilliant model of accepting art donations nationwide to support local Cleveland youth. Reference their Plexus membership and commitment to the community.

Emphasize the challenge nonprofits face marketing with limited budgets, especially when explaining a unique model (art gallery supporting youth homelessness). Offer pro-bono or discounted marketing support to help them:
- Drive more traffic to online gallery
- Recruit more art donations
- Reach art collectors and LGBTQ+ donors nationally
- Promote auction events
- Tell the story of impact

Position this as mission-aligned work - helping them reach more people means more resources for vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth.
