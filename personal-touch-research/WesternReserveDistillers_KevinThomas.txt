=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on being the ONLY US-made agave spirit to ever win Tequila Aficionado Brand of Promise! That's a historic achievement that puts Cleveland-area craftsmanship on the international map. Also mention the 2nd Best Whiskey in the World recognition - remarkable.

Acknowledge what a bold move it was for Kevin to leave a 25-year career at Nestlé to start Ohio's first and only USDA certified organic craft distillery with Ann. Reference his chemical engineering degree and global innovation experience - serious credentials backing serious spirits.

Point out the commitment to local, organic sourcing - Twin Parks Organic Farm 75 miles away for grains, organic molasses, organic agave. That's real sustainability, not greenwashing.

Acknowledge the challenge of educating consumers about organic spirits' value when big brands spend millions on marketing. Share how Western Reserve represents the opposite of corporate spirits - family owned, locally sourced, world-class quality.

Mention the Honeycomb Credit community funding success ($100K+) as proof that Cleveland supports local excellence. Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help more Clevelanders discover they have a world-award-winning distillery in their backyard.

Offer to discuss driving tasting room traffic and reaching customers who value organic, local, family-owned over mass-produced corporate brands.

Position as supporting a family-owned Cleveland-area business that's winning international recognition while staying rooted in local community.
