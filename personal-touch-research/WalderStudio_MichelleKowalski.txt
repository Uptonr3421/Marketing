=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on FIVE YEARS in business and 70+ clients! That's a significant milestone, especially for a women-owned design firm that started in 2019 right before the pandemic. Acknowledge what a journey that must have been.

Mention seeing them in Plexus directory as a fellow member and note Michelle's Cleveland roots. Reference the Exit Planning Institute feature for National Women's Small Business Month - well-deserved recognition!

Acknowledge the unique challenge of running a collaborative design firm across two cities (Cleveland and Austin) and serving nonprofits/community organizations who often have limited budgets but unlimited mission-driven needs.

Share appreciation for their stated philosophy of wanting to provide "wider range of services to more specific set of clients" - that intentional niche focus is smart but can be hard to communicate in marketing.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help nonprofits and businesses discover their WOSB-certified firm, especially organizations looking for women-owned vendors. Mention potential collaboration opportunities - they create the brand foundation, your agency could help market those businesses.

Position as one women-owned business supporting another, both in the Plexus community and both committed to serving nonprofits and mission-driven organizations.
