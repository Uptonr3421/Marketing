=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on Notable Latino Leader 2023 recognition and the beautiful permanent Gordon Square location! Mention how exciting it must be to have a true home for Yellowcake after years at 78th Street Studios.

Reference El Corazon marketplace and the vision of creating space for other small businesses - that's remarkable generosity and community leadership. Acknowledge her Project Runway journey and how she's built sustainable success in Cleveland rather than chasing New York or LA.

Mention the challenge of educating customers about sustainable, upcycled luxury fashion when they're bombarded with fast fashion prices. Point out how Yellowcake represents the opposite of overconsumption - timeless pieces that last years vs. disposable trends.

Share appreciation for her 15+ years fighting fast fashion before sustainability became a buzzword. Acknowledge the unique challenge of marketing TWO businesses: Yellowcake clothing AND El Corazon marketplace.

Suggest discussing how strategic storytelling could help reach customers who value quality and sustainability, and how to showcase the El Corazon small businesses she's supporting. Mention Gordon Square's LGBTQ+-friendly vibe and potential Plexus connections.

Position as supporting a fellow champion of small businesses - both committed to sustainable, quality alternatives over fast/cheap corporate options.
