=== BUSINESS DESCRIPTION ===
The Elliot is a boutique wedding and event venue housed in a former church - the historic Holy Ghost Church which served the community from 1909 to 2009. This stunning venue features historic architecture with modern amenities, including a grand ballroom with staircase leading to a balcony and a speakeasy called The Rosehip Room in the lower level. They specialize in weddings, engagement parties, bridal showers, rehearsal dinners, ceremonies, cocktail hours, receptions, corporate events, and celebrations of all kinds.

=== RECENT WINS/NEWS/ACHIEVEMENTS ===

• Katie Mang joined the team in 2022 and has quickly become beloved by clients
• Featured in Cleveland's wedding industry as a premier LGBTQ-friendly venue
• Exceptional client reviews praising Katie's coordination skills: "Huge kudos to Katie Mang who coordinated everything" and "Incredibly kind, empathetic, and patient"
• Continues to be a sought-after venue for couples seeking an intimate, historic setting in Cleveland's vibrant Tremont neighborhood

=== PERSONALIZATION HOOKS ===
1. Katie has over 20 years of experience in event operations and nonprofit management - she brings deep community knowledge and operational excellence to every event
2. The venue's transformation from a century-old church (Holy Ghost Church, 1909-2009) into a modern event space represents Cleveland's commitment to historic preservation and adaptive reuse
3. Strong LGBTQ+ ally - actively welcoming and hosting same-sex weddings, creating an inclusive and affirming space for all couples
4. The Rosehip Room speakeasy adds a unique, intimate element that sets them apart from traditional wedding venues
5. Located in Tremont, one of Cleveland's most artistic and culturally diverse neighborhoods, showing commitment to local community

=== PAIN POINTS ===
• Standing out in Cleveland's competitive wedding venue market
• Marketing to diverse audiences and ensuring LGBTQ+ couples know they're genuinely welcome (not just tolerant)
• Building brand awareness beyond word-of-mouth referrals
• Showcasing the unique features (historic church architecture, speakeasy, balcony) through compelling visual storytelling
• Reaching couples who value authenticity and local Cleveland culture over cookie-cutter venues
• Competing with larger, more established venues while highlighting their boutique, personalized approach

=== COMMON GROUND OPPORTUNITIES ===
• Shared commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusivity - both The Elliot and Plexus create welcoming spaces for the community
• Support for Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood revitalization and local business ecosystem
• Values authenticity and personalized service over corporate/cookie-cutter approaches
• Appreciation for historic preservation and adaptive reuse of Cleveland landmarks
• Katie's nonprofit management background aligns with community-focused business values
• Could benefit from Plexus networking events to connect with LGBTQ+ couples planning weddings

=== COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS ===
• Listed as Event Planning member of Plexus LGBT & Allied Chamber of Commerce
• Active in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood business community
• Serves LGBTQ+ couples with affirming, inclusive wedding services
• Katie's 20+ years in nonprofit management suggests strong Cleveland community ties

=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Lead with congratulations on the beautiful LGBTQ+ wedding coverage (Rachael + Monica) and Katie's exceptional client reviews. Acknowledge the challenge of marketing a boutique venue's unique story - the holy-to-hospitality transformation of a century-old church into an inclusive celebration space. Reference how The Elliot represents the best of Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood: historic, artistic, authentically welcoming.

Mention seeing them in the Plexus directory and offer to discuss how strategic branding and visual storytelling can help LGBTQ+ couples discover their affirming venue. Share ideas about showcasing the Rosehip Room speakeasy and grand ballroom through compelling content that attracts couples who value character over convention.

Position as a partnership between two Cleveland businesses committed to creating inclusive spaces where everyone belongs.
