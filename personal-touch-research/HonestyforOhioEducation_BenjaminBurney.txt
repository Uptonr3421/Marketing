Company: Honesty for Ohio Education (HFOE)

========================================
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
========================================
Honesty for Ohio Education (HFOE) was established in the summer of 2021 as a nonpartisan, statewide coalition that believes every student deserves an honest high-quality education grounded in truth, facts, and diverse perspectives regardless of race, identity, background, or zip code.

The organization champions honesty in education, the empowerment of students, families and educators, and the affirmation of identities, cultures, and experiences. Born from grassroots efforts of students, parents, educators, and organizations, HFOE now represents more than 40 organizational partners and countless Ohioans across the state.

HFOE conducts work at three critical access points to education: the Ohio Statehouse, the State Board of Education, and local school districts.
