=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Lead with recognition that LGBTQ+ Lorain County is the FIRST organized LGBTQ+ group in the entire county - that's historic and took real courage to launch in 2017.

Acknowledge the critical work of connecting LGBTQ+ individuals in Lorain County who might otherwise feel isolated - in more suburban/rural areas, finding community can be life-changing or even life-saving.

Highlight their smart strategy of networking with larger NE Ohio organizations rather than trying to do everything alone - that's strategic thinking and collaboration.

Express admiration for 8 years of sustained operation despite being volunteer-driven with limited resources - that's dedication and community commitment.

Offer to help them reach more Lorain County residents (both LGBTQ+ individuals who need community AND allies who want to support), amplify their Pride events and programs, and attract more donors/volunteers to sustain and grow their impact.

Connect over shared mission through Plexus: building LGBTQ+ community and visibility in Northeast Ohio.
