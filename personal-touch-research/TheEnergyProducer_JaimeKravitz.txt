=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with congratulations on the incredible $170K fundraising achievement and her "12 Under 36" recognition. Acknowledge the unique challenge of marketing yourself as more than "just a DJ" - she's a master of ceremonies, auctioneer, fundraiser, and mentor all in one.

Reference her work with Cleveland STEM Goes Red for Girls and commitment to empowering the next generation. Mention how her woman-owned business is breaking barriers in entertainment while making measurable impact for nonprofits.

Suggest discussing how strategic branding can help nonprofits discover her fundraising auctioneer expertise (since many galas don't know professional auctioneers like her exist locally). Share ideas about showcasing her dual expertise: high-energy entertainment AND fundraising results.

Position as supporting a fellow Cleveland woman entrepreneur who's raising up the next generation while raising record funds for causes that matter.
