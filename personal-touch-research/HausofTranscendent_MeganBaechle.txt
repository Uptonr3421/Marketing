========================================
PAIN POINTS
========================================

1. **Sustaining $829K Grant Impact**: Receiving major grant is wonderful, but spending it effectively, meeting grant requirements, and demonstrating impact for future funding requires capacity.

2. **Operational Capacity**: Young organization (founded 2023) scaling quickly needs systems, processes, staff, and infrastructure to manage growth sustainably.

3. **Community Awareness**: Many LGBTQ+ people experiencing housing insecurity may not know HOT exists. Outreach to vulnerable, often transient population is challenging.

4. **Ongoing Funding**: While $829K grant is significant, housing programs require sustained funding. Need diverse revenue streams (individual donors, corporate sponsors, additional grants).

5. **Building Out Housing**: Converting 8,600 sq ft building to functional, welcoming transitional housing requires construction, furnishing, safety compliance, and creating supportive environment.

========================================
COMMON GROUND OPPORTUNITIES
========================================

1. **LGBTQ+ Housing Crisis**: LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender individuals and LGBTQ+ youth, experience homelessness at disproportionate rates. HOT addresses urgent, life-saving need.

2. **Intersectionality Focus**: Multilingual, multicultural leadership recognizes that LGBTQ+ homelessness disproportionately affects LGBTQ+ people of color, immigrants, and those with intersecting marginalized identities.

3. **Low-Barrier Approach**: Unlike many housing programs with strict requirements, HOT's low-barrier model meets people where they are - crucial for serving most vulnerable.

4. **Social Determinants of Health**: HOT addresses housing, economic stability, and community connection - evidence-based approach to health equity.

5. **Arts & Culture Integration**: Including arts programming recognizes creative expression as healing, community-building tool and honors LGBTQ+ community's cultural contributions.
