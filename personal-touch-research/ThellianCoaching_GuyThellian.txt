=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open as a fellow Plexus member congratulating Guy on recently retiring from his 9-5 career to pursue coaching full-time. That takes real courage, especially later in career! Acknowledge what an exciting and uncertain time it must be building a coaching practice from the ground up.

Reference his unique offering of NeurOptimal® neurofeedback brain training alongside traditional life coaching - that specialized expertise sets him apart. Point out the challenge of educating people about neurofeedback when many don't know it exists or how it works.

Acknowledge his beautiful commitment to accessibility with sliding fee scale and "ability to pay never an impediment" - that's rare and reflects genuine values. Mention how valuable it is for LGBTQ+ community to have openly queer life coaches, especially for clients who've experienced discrimination or don't feel safe with heterosexual coaches.

Share that many Plexus members and LGBTQ+ individuals in Cleveland need exactly what he offers but might not know to search for "queer life coach with neurofeedback training."

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help build his coaching practice in this critical startup phase. Offer to brainstorm how to communicate NeurOptimal® benefits and reach LGBTQ+ clients seeking affirming coaching.

Position as one Plexus member supporting another through major career transition, both committed to serving LGBTQ+ community authentically.
