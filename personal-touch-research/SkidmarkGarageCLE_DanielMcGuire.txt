BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Skidmark Garage is a "no-collar" community DIY motorcycle garage where riders work on their own motorcycles with access to tools, space, and community assistance. The 10,000 sq ft facility operates like a gym membership - members pay a fee for access to all tools and support from fellow members. Recently moved to 5401 Hamilton Ave on the eastern edge of AsiaTown (near East 55th and St. Clair). Skidmark Garage is one of only 25 community garages in the United States.
