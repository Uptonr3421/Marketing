FOUNDERS' STORY & BACKGROUND
===========================================
Shelley and John Pippin are two Clevelanders who "gave up their jobs working for 'The Man'" to pursue their three favorite things: donuts, beer, and Cleveland.

Origin Story (2013):
Frustrated with the corporate grind, the Cleveland natives launched Brewnuts with NO prior experience in the food/beverage industry. The idea came spontaneously - one night Shelley bolted up in bed and asked John what he thought about opening a donut bar. After a long pause, he said "I like that."

The very next day, they went out and bought a countertop fryer and started hatching their plan to make Cleveland's most unique and delicious donuts. They combined their love for craft beer and handmade pastries into one concept.

The Journey:
- Started at Cleveland Flea events in 2013 to test the concept and build following
- Cleveland Flea helped launch many of Cleveland's successful entrepreneurs including Brewnuts
- Grew from flea market vendor to permanent brick-and-mortar location
- Built collaborative relationships with Cleveland's brewery scene
- Spent the last 10+ years "absolutely knocking the socks off locals"
