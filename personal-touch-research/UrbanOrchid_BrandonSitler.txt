=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open with huge congratulations on winning Best Florist 2024 from Cleveland Scene! Mention how impressive it is to earn that recognition again after also winning in 2012 - demonstrating sustained excellence over more than a decade.

Reference the TWO locations in some of Cleveland's most beloved neighborhoods - the historic Ohio City Firehouse and vibrant Tremont. Acknowledge the unique business model of being both an award-winning florist AND a curated marketplace for local artists (jewelers, painters, glass blowers, ceramicists, graphic designers, sewers).

Point out the challenge of communicating that breadth - many people might not realize Urban Orchid is a destination for locally-made gifts and art, not just flowers. Mention how the commitment to local growers, suppliers, and artists represents real economic impact for Cleveland's creative community.

Suggest discussing how to leverage the Best Florist 2024 award for marketing momentum and how to better showcase the local artisan marketplace aspect of the business. Share ideas about reaching LGBTQ+ couples (Tremont and Ohio City are LGBTQ+-friendly neighborhoods) for weddings.

Position as supporting a fellow champion of Cleveland's local creative economy - both committed to elevating local artists and makers over mass-produced alternatives.
