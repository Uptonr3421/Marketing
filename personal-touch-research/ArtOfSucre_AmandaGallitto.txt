BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
===========================================
Art of Sucre (French for "Art of Sugar") is a gourmet cotton candy e-commerce company specializing in uniquely delicious flavors of cotton candy and viral Cotton Candy Glitter Bombs. Founded in 2016 by Emily Harpel while wedding planning, the business gives the traditional childhood treat a chic, modern upgrade.

Products include:
- Hand-spun cotton candy in 20+ creative flavors (Champagne, Orange Bourbon, Watermelon, etc.)
- Cotton Candy Glitter Bombs - puffs of cotton candy with edible glitter that dissolve in beverages, creating a magical, sparkly drink
- Custom flavors for events and corporate clients
- Wholesale products available through retailers

The business started as a live cart service spinning cotton candy at weddings and events, then pivoted to packaged e-commerce during the 2020 pandemic with massive success through TikTok viral marketing.

===========================================
FOUNDER'S STORY & BACKGROUND
===========================================
Emily Harpel is a Cuyahoga Falls native and graduate of Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy. She earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Akron, with original plans to attend graduate school.

Instead, while wedding planning in 2016, Emily was inspired to create a chic upgrade to the traditional cotton candy experience. She launched Art of Sucre with bold, inventive flavors, spinning fresh cones at weddings, events, and parties around Northeast Ohio.

When the pandemic hit on March 12, 2020 (ironically around her wedding anniversary), her events-based business came to a complete halt with stay-at-home orders. Faced with losing her business, Emily made a bold pivot to e-commerce and TikTok marketing.

She started posting multiple daily TikTok videos in June 2020, reaching 1 million followers by October 2020 (just 4 months later!). When she officially launched online ordering on March 15, 2021, she sold out of more than 4,000 units of cotton candy in just 40 minutes.

SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH

Lead with the EPIC pivot story - from events shutdown on her wedding anniversary (March 12, 2020) to 1 million TikTok followers by October 2020 to selling 4,000 units in 40 minutes by March 2021. This is one of the most inspiring pandemic pivot stories in Northeast Ohio.

Reference the 25-million-view wedding dress video - it's iconic, memorable, and shows creative problem-solving. Acknowledge being TikTok Shop's FIRST brand partner (huge credibility).

Mention the American Girl cafes partnership and major brand collabs to show you understand her success level - she's not a small startup anymore, she's scaled.

But also acknowledge the $40,000 packaging lesson learned - shows you've done deep research and understand entrepreneurship includes failures, not just wins.

Position marketing/branding services as support for the NEXT phase:
- Diversifying beyond TikTok dependency (email marketing, SEO, brand awareness)
- Scaling brand identity to match the explosive growth
- PR strategy to capitalize on viral success for traditional media
- Partnership marketing materials for retail expansion
- Website optimization to handle traffic (and not crash during launches!)
- Content strategy to maintain viral momentum while building sustainable marketing
- Expanding beyond "Queen of Cotton Candy" to build lasting brand equity
- Marketing analytics to understand which customers/channels drive best LTV

Tone: Enthusiastic, impressed by her achievement, understanding of hyper-growth challenges. She's moved FAST and may need strategic support to build sustainable marketing foundation beneath the viral success. Position as partner to help her go from viral sensation to enduring brand.
