Open as a fellow Plexus member reaching out to someone who literally wrote the book on LGBTQ+ HR! Congratulate Rachel on publishing THREE equity-focused HR guides in just 4 years: Anti-Racist HR (2020), Reframing Pride LGBTQ+ HR (2021), and Equitable Hiring (2024). That's remarkable thought leadership.

Acknowledge the significant career pivot in 2023 - retiring from a 16-year fashion design career to focus on HR consulting full-time shows real commitment to this work. Mention how rare it is to find HR consultants who are truly equity-centered and trauma-informed, not just using buzzwords.

Reference her work with Reproductive Rights and Human Rights nonprofits and the presentation at Black Remote She event. Point out the challenge of reaching organizations that genuinely value equitable, trauma-informed HR practices vs. those doing performative DEI.

Share appreciation for "Reframing Pride: The LGBTQ+ HR Guide" and how valuable that resource is for LGBTQ+ businesses. Mention that many Plexus members need exactly her expertise but might not know trauma-informed, equity-centered HR consulting exists.

Suggest discussing how strategic marketing could help more nonprofits and LGBTQ+ organizations discover her specialized expertise. Offer to discuss converting thought leadership (the published guides) into client acquisition.

Position as one Plexus member supporting another, both committed to creating truly equitable, inclusive workplaces through your respective expertise.
