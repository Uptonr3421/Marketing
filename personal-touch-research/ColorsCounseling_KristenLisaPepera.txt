They also founded Colors+, a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit LGBTQ+ youth center.

SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH:
Lead with recognition of the incredible vision and commitment it took to create both a counseling practice AND a nonprofit youth center for LGBTQ+ youth. Acknowledge that they saw a gap in services and didn't just talk about it - they filled it.

Highlight their lived experience and how that informs culturally competent care in ways others can't provide. Reference their TV media features as evidence of community recognition.

Emphasize the challenge of marketing two related but distinct organizations, especially when serving marginalized communities. Offer strategic marketing support to help them reach more LGBTQ+ youth and families who desperately need affirming care but don't know where to find it.

Connect through Plexus community and shared values around LGBTQ+ inclusion and youth support.
