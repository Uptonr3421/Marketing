SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH
===========================================
Lead with appreciation for 7 years of dedicated service to Cleveland families - that's significant longevity in the doula field, showing true commitment.

Reference the LGBTQ+ friendly designation and comprehensive approach (all birth types, no judgment) - shows you understand her values of inclusivity and meeting families where they are.

Mention the dual expertise as birth doula AND lactation counselor - this continuity of care is valuable and differentiating.

Acknowledge the empowerment philosophy ("Empowering Parents from Pregnancy to Parenthood") - this positions parents as capable, not helpless.

Recognize the challenge of being a solo practitioner on-call for births while also managing business operations.

Position marketing/branding services as support for:
- SEO so expecting families searching "Cleveland doula" or "LGBTQ friendly doula Cleveland" find her
- Instagram presence to reach millennial/Gen Z expecting parents (who live on Instagram)
- Content strategy sharing birth education, lactation tips, empowerment messages
- Email nurture sequence for inquiries who aren't ready to book yet
- Referral partner cultivation with OB/GYNs, midwives, prenatal yoga studios
- Google My Business optimization for local search
- Testimonial strategy (with client permission) to build trust
- Website optimization to clearly communicate services, values, and booking process
- Professional brand identity that feels warm, empowering, evidence-based (not crunchy-granola stereotype)
- Educational content about doula benefits (many families don't know what doulas do)
- Partnership marketing with Nurtured Foundation and other complementary services

Tone: Warm, respectful of birth work, understanding of on-call lifestyle challenges. Acknowledge doulas are underpaid for the value they provide. Position as partner who can help build sustainable business so she can continue serving families.

===========================================
DOULA SERVICES CONTEXT
===========================================
For marketing purposes, important to understand what doulas do:

**Doulas provide (non-medical):**
- Emotional support and encouragement during labor
- Physical comfort measures (positioning, massage, breathing techniques)
- Continuous presence throughout labor (unlike nurses who rotate shifts)
- Partner/support person coaching
- Evidence-based information about birth options
- Advocacy for client preferences
- Postpartum support with newborn care, feeding, emotional adjustment

**Research shows doula support leads to:**
- Shorter labors
- Lower cesarean rates
- Less use of pain medication
- Higher satisfaction with birth experience
- Better breastfeeding initiation rates
- Lower rates of postpartum depression

**Key differentiators:**
Doulas don't replace medical care (OB/midwife) - they complement it with continuous emotional/physical support. They serve the parents, not the institution.

This context helps position the value Bamboo Birth provides to Cleveland families.

===========================================
TARGET CLIENTELE
===========================================
