BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
===========================================
Akron Pride Custom Tees is a small LGBTQ+ and Hispanic-owned custom apparel business specializing in personalized t-shirts and merchandise. They offer customization services for all sizes from infant to plus-size/curvy, including t-shirts, aprons, face masks, ornaments, and tote bags. The business uses multiple print methods including vinyl, white toner, DTG (direct to garment), and Ultracolor Pro.

The business was founded in June 2020 during the pandemic by Jose Alvarado, who converted his finished basement into an office/production space to fulfill his dream of starting a t-shirt business.

===========================================
FOUNDER'S STORY & BACKGROUND
===========================================
Jose Alvarado started this business after identifying a personal pain point: "I always found it difficult to find theme shirts for my gay cruise on short notice." This frustration motivated him to create a solution that would serve the LGBTQ+ community.

During the 2020 pandemic lockdown, Jose used his time to research and watch YouTube videos on how to start a t-shirt business. He began making shirts for friends and family, then expanded to an Etsy shop, and eventually launched a full website.

Jose works from his converted basement office where he houses all the products and equipment needed for the business.
