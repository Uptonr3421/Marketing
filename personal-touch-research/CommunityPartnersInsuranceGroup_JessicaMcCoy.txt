SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH:
Lead with recognition of their unique positioning as an insurance agency dedicated exclusively to the LGBTQ+ community. Acknowledge that many LGBTQ+ people don't even realize there are insurance considerations specific to their families and businesses, and that having a dedicated agency matters.
