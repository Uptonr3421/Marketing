FOUNDERS' STORY & BACKGROUND
===========================================
Co-founders Jillian Neimeister and Tricia Tortoreti met at a CrossFit gym in 2009. Both became certified trainers and began envisioning how they would run their own gym differently.

The duo took action by enrolling in Bad Girl Ventures' fall business training program, where they completely re-wrote their business plan throughout the course. Their dedication and business acumen paid off when they won a $25,000 loan from Bad Girl Ventures (BGV).

They also secured a loan from BGV loan partner Economic Community Development Institute (ECDI) and opened Birdtown CrossFit in the Lake Erie Building in Lakewood's Birdtown neighborhood in January 2013.

Before opening, they ran a fundraising campaign to purchase equipment. Demonstrating community values from day one, they promised to donate a one-year membership to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Cleveland for every $2,000 raised. The campaign raised $7,260, resulting in donated memberships to support Cleveland youth.

Current Leadership:
- Jillian Neimeister also serves as Head of Customer Success at AmpliFund (CGMS, PMP credentials)
- Shows entrepreneurial experience beyond the gym - business leadership skills

===========================================
Lead with the inspiring founding story - two women who met at a CrossFit gym, became trainers, went through Bad Girl Ventures training, won funding, and opened their own gym in 2013. That's 11+ years of sustained success in a challenging industry.

Reference the Big Brothers Big Sisters partnership from day one - shows their values weren't an afterthought, they built community giving into their business model from the start.

Acknowledge the "more than just a gym - it's a family" philosophy. In an era of impersonal big box gyms, this differentiator matters.

Mention the 11-year anniversary milestone and surviving/thriving through the pandemic - huge achievement for small fitness business.

Position marketing/branding services as support for:
- Instagram growth strategy (fitness content performs well on IG)
- SEO for "CrossFit Cleveland," "functional fitness Lakewood," "women-owned gym"

- Content strategy showcasing the "family" atmosphere
- Member testimonial/transformation story campaigns

- Paid social ads targeting Cleveland suburbs (Lakewood, Rocky River, Westlake, etc.)
- Differentiation messaging from big box gyms and other CrossFit gyms
- Leveraging BGV alumni network for cross-promotion
- Video content showing workouts, community events, trainer expertise

Tone: Energetic, appreciative of their 11-year journey, understanding of fitness industry challenges. Acknowledge they've built something special - a community, not just a business. Position as partner to help them reach more people who need that family-like fitness atmosphere.
