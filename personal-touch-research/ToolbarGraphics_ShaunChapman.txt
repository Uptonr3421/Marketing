=== SUGGESTED EMAIL APPROACH ===
Open as a fellow Plexus member reaching out to support a fellow LGBT-owned creative business in Cleveland. Congratulate Shaun on the business evolution - from sticker company to small business branding (2018) to nonprofit campaigns (2023). That growth trajectory shows real entrepreneurial vision and market awareness.

Reference his philosophy that "websites are the new brick and mortar" - absolutely true, and many small businesses still don't understand that their website IS their storefront. Acknowledge the challenge of educating small business owners about the value of professional design when they're often focused on saving money.

Mention the recent expansion into nonprofit campaigns (2023) and how that mission-driven work probably aligns with his values as an LGBT-owned business. Ask about his experience working with nonprofits and what inspired that expansion.

Share that you also work with Plexus and LGBTQ+ businesses and would love to discuss potential collaboration - your agency helps businesses with marketing strategy and they need strong brand foundations (which Toolbar Graphics creates).

Position as a partnership conversation between two LGBT-owned creative businesses in the Plexus community, both committed to helping small businesses and nonprofits tell their stories effectively.
