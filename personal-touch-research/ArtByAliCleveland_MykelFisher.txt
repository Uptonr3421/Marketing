===========================================
Lead with the incredible 30-year journey - from selling art at age 11 to going full-time in 2021. This is a compelling entrepreneurial story that deserves recognition and celebration.

Reference the unique upcycling philosophy ("taking broken things and creating something new") - it's poetic, memorable, and speaks to transformation, which connects beautifully to marketing/branding services helping businesses transform their visibility.

Acknowledge the brave decision to go full-time in 2021 and the diverse skill set (face painting to woodworking to teaching). Show understanding that managing the business side of art can take time away from creating.

Position marketing/branding services as support for:
- Professional website redesign showcasing portfolio with high-quality images
- Social media strategy to grow following beyond festival attendees
- Email marketing to past custom commission clients
- SEO to appear when people search "custom art Cleveland" or "woodworking artist Ohio"
- Content calendar for sharing work-in-progress and behind-the-scenes
- Branding that reflects the upcycling philosophy and multi-disciplinary approach
- Festival marketing materials (postcards, business cards, signage)
- Online shop optimization for selling work beyond in-person events

Tone: Warm, appreciative of artistic talent, understanding of creative entrepreneurship. Acknowledge art as the priority and position marketing as the support system to handle business growth so she can focus on creating.
