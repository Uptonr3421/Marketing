## DEEP PERSONALIZATION STRATEGIES BY BUSINESS TYPE

### For LGBTQ+ Pioneers (India Ink, Snowbright, Innate Electric):
**Opening Line:** "As [Akron's first Black queer-owned tattoo shop / the creator of gaming's first nonbinary character / a trans woman breaking barriers in electrical trades], you're not just running a business—you're making history..."

**Pain Point:** "The challenge of being 'the first' is that people notice when you struggle, but they don't always celebrate when you succeed. Your story deserves amplification."

**Value Prop:** "I specialize in helping trailblazing LGBTQ+ businesses tell their stories in ways that attract the right customers AND inspire the next generation who need to see it's possible."

### For Pandemic Pivots (Cloak & Dagger, Art of Sucre):
**Opening Line:** "Opening a [vegan cocktail bar / pivoting to e-commerce] in [October 2020 / March 2020] took incredible courage. While others were closing, you were building..."

**Pain Point:** "That kind of resilience is your competitive advantage—but only if people know about it. Your pandemic story is powerful social proof."

**Value Prop:** "Let's turn your pivot story into a marketing asset that shows you're not just surviving—you're thriving."

### For Trans/NB Advocates (Emma Parker, Allison Harrison, Chelsea Brennan):
**Opening Line:** "Your work [photographing trans visibility / providing legal support at name clinics / creating affirming workplaces] goes way beyond business—you're changing lives..."

**Pain Point:** "The people who need your services most often struggle to find you. Trans-affirming [photography / legal / employment] is hard to discover without the right marketing."

**Value Prop:** "I can help you reach more of the trans and nonbinary community who desperately need what you offer but don't know you exist."

### For Award Winners (Snowbright, Yellowcake, Buckeye Flame):
**Opening Line:** "Congratulations on [Games for Change Vanguard Award / Notable Latino Leader 2023 / National LGBTQ+ Journalist of the Year]! That kind of recognition proves you're doing something exceptional..."

**Pain Point:** "Major awards are incredible validation, but they're often underutilized as marketing assets. Most people outside your immediate circle don't know about your achievement."

**Value Prop:** "Let's leverage [award name] to open doors—media features, speaking opportunities, corporate partnerships, and customers who want to work with award-winning businesses."

### For Mission-Driven (Colors+ Counseling, Snowbright, Buckeye Flame):
**Opening Line:** "Building a [counseling practice AND nonprofit youth center / educational game company with 50% nonbinary team / nonprofit newsroom] shows you're not just chasing profit—you're building something that matters..."

**Pain Point:** "Mission-driven businesses often struggle with the 'marketing feels salesy' problem. You want to grow, but you don't want to compromise your values."

**Value Prop:** "I specialize in values-aligned marketing that feels authentic because it IS authentic. Let's grow your impact without sacrificing your soul."

### For Community Leaders (Allison Harrison, Valerie Mayen):
**Opening Line:** "Between [running your law firm / Yellowcake Shop], hosting ['Cbus Mob' podcast / El Corazon marketplace], and serving as [Diversity Chamber President / Notable Latino Leader], you're not just running a business—you're building an ecosystem..."

**Pain Point:** "The more you give back, the less time you have to market yourself. Your community leadership is incredible, but you need someone helping YOU while you help everyone else."

**Value Prop:** "Let me take marketing off your plate so you can keep doing what you do best—leading and elevating the entire community."

## THE GOLDMINE: INTERCONNECTIONS

### Businesses That Know Each Other:

**Allison Harrison's Network:**
- "Cbus Mob" podcast features LGBTQ+ businesses (including The Buckeye Flame)
- President of Diversity Chamber (connects to all Columbus LGBTQ+ businesses)
- Board of Stonewall Columbus (connects to Emma Parker - 2022 Leader of Pride)

**Plexus Network:**
- Multiple businesses already connected through events
- Shared community, likely know each other or have mutual connections

**Media Connections:**
- The Buckeye Flame covers LGBTQ+ Ohio businesses
- Multiple businesses featured in Cleveland Magazine
- WKYC features several businesses

### Referral Strategy:
**After working with one Plexus business, ask:** "Who else in the Plexus network do you think could benefit from [specific result you delivered]? I'd love a warm introduction."

**Network Effect:** In tight-knit LGBTQ+ community, one satisfied client = 5+ warm referrals.

---

## EMAIL PERSONALIZATION CHECKLIST

Before sending to ANY Plexus business, verify you can answer YES to:

- [ ] Did I mention their specific LGBTQ+ connection/certification?
- [ ] Did I reference a recent win, award, or media feature?
- [ ] Did I show understanding of their mission beyond profit?
- [ ] Did I acknowledge a barrier they've broken or challenge they've overcome?
- [ ] Did I mention Cleveland/Akron pride or local commitment?
- [ ] Did I reference Plexus membership (if applicable)?
- [ ] Did I connect through shared values (not just business transaction)?
- [ ] Did I show I understand their specific industry challenges?
- [ ] Does this email feel like peer-to-peer (founder to founder)?
- [ ] Would I respond to this email if I received it?

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS: THE META-PATTERN

**What ALL These Businesses Share:**

They're **authentic**.

They didn't compromise who they are to build successful businesses. They built successful businesses BECAUSE of who they are.

- Chelsea Brennan didn't hide being trans to succeed in electrical trades—she leads with it.
- India Rush didn't replicate the dark tattoo parlor—she created light-filled inclusive space.
- Emily Harpel didn't chase New York fashion—she built sustainable fashion in Fairlawn.
- Allison Harrison didn't separate her LGBTQ+ identity from her law practice—she made it central.

**Your Marketing Must Match Their Authenticity:**

No rainbow-washing.
No corporate BS.
No "we help businesses like yours" generic templates.

**Every email should say:** "I SEE you. I understand what you're building. I respect the courage it takes. Let me help amplify it."

---

**This is the playbook. This is the common ground. This is how we win. 🏳️‍🌈**
