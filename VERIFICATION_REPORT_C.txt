❌ INCORRECT:
- Camper numbers: File claims "75 campers per week by 2023" but sources state "over 150 campers" total for the summer in 2023 (two weeks). This suggests approximately 75-80 per week is mathematically possible, but the phrasing implies growth TO 75 per week, when actually they grew to 150+ total

⚠️ UNCERTAIN:
- Contact person "Todd Robinson" - NO EVIDENCE found linking this name to Catharsis Counseling CLE
- Email listed as Kaleigh@CatharsisCLE.com (logical but not independently verified in searches)

❌ INCORRECT:
- Contact listing: File lists "Contact Name: Todd Robinson" but all evidence points to Kaleigh Turick as the primary/only therapist and contact

📝 CORRECTIONS:
- REMOVE "Todd Robinson" as contact - no evidence of connection to this practice
- Change primary contact to "Kaleigh Turick, LPCC-S, PMH-C"
- Verify where "Todd Robinson" name came from - possible confusion with different practice

==================================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:

1. **CATHARSIS COUNSELING CLE**: Contact name "Todd Robinson" appears INCORRECT - should be Kaleigh Turick

2. **COLORS+ COUNSELING**: Claim that "Kristen and Lisa are no longer with the organization as of 2025" could not be verified - CRITICAL to confirm before outreach

3. **CLEVER GIRL MARKETING**: Major clients (Cleveland Clinic, Tri-C, Cuyahoga Land Bank, OAESV) could not be verified - do not reference in outreach without confirmation

4. **CROWBAR/CROBAR**: Business name misspelled, contact persons not verified - verify all contact information

5. **CAMP LILAC**: Contact "Allison Baker" not found in research - verify contact person

6. **CREATIVE SOLUTIONS COUNSELING**: Education discrepancy (Kent State vs Ohio University)

7. **CRACK CORN LTD**: Award description overstated

8. **CLEVELAND SEX THERAPY**: Minor date discrepancy on certification (Sept vs Nov 2021)

==================================================================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

STRONG VERIFICATION RATE: Approximately 85% of major claims verified across multiple sources

BUSINESSES WITH COMPLETE VERIFICATION:
- Community Partners Insurance Group
- Compass Policy Strategies
- Cloak & Dagger (with minor clarifications)

BUSINESSES NEEDING CORRECTIONS BEFORE OUTREACH:
- Catharsis Counseling CLE (wrong contact name)
- Colors+ Counseling (verify founder status)
- Clever Girl Marketing (unverified client claims)
- Crowbar/Crobar (name spelling, unverified contacts)
- Creative Solutions Counseling (education discrepancy)

RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT proceed with outreach to businesses with critical errors (especially Catharsis Counseling CLE and Colors+ Counseling) until corrections are verified.
