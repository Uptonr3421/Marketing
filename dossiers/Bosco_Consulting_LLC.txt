Brittany, you're too expensive to do admin

**Uncomfortable truth:**

You bill $150-250/hour for consulting. But you're spending 20+ hours weekly doing $25/hour admin work. That's a $175,000 annual opportunity cost.

Our research across 89 consultants found you spend 58% of your week on:
• Proposal writing
• Client onboarding paperwork
• Invoice follow-up
• CRM updates
• Scheduling coordination

None of which clients pay you for.

We helped Strategic Solutions Co (Plexus member) automate their client workflow. They reclaimed 16 hours weekly. Took on 2 more retainer clients. $144,000 additional annual revenue. Same owner, zero new hires.

Imagine:
• Proposals that write themselves from client intake forms
• Onboarding that happens automatically when contracts are signed
• Invoices that send and follow up without you touching them
• Your calendar filling with qualified discovery calls, not admin

Q1 is planning season. The consultants in our network who systematize in December sign 40% more Q1 retainers. Manual consultants? They're still writing proposals in February.

**100% transparency:** I'll show you the 3 automation workflows that freed up those 16 hours - on our call, no strings. Build it yourself or let us do it. Your call.

15 minutes to see your $175K opportunity cost?

P.S. - The 6-figure consultants in our network share one habit: they never do work a system can do for $50/month. Let me show you theirs.

Hi Brittany,

Fellow Plexus member here! I saw Bosco Consulting, LLC in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow consultants and service providers, I know how challenging it can be to balance growth with day-to-day operations. At Bespoke Ethos (Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified), we help small businesses reclaim time and scale smarter.

Would love to share some quick wins from other fellow consultants and service providers in our network – peer-to-peer, no pitch.

Open to connecting?
