Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Lady Luck Studio LLC

Hi Brendan,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Lady Luck Studio LLC in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow creatives and designers, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Client revisions and scope creep eating into profits
• Inconsistent project pipeline and income
• Time spent on admin vs. creative work

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow creatives and designers with:

• Project management tools with clear scope boundaries
• Marketing automation for consistent client flow
• Systems reclaiming 20% more time for creative work

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]

P.S. - As fellow LGBTQ+-allied businesses, supporting each other's success is what our community is all about.
