Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Dezfox, LLC

Hi Toya,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Dezfox, LLC in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow small business owners, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Finding time to work ON your business instead of just IN it
• Inconsistent revenue and cash flow management
• Administrative tasks consuming valuable time

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow small business owners with:

• Operations systems reclaiming 15+ hours per week
• Financial planning tools for small business stability
• Automation handling repetitive tasks

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]
