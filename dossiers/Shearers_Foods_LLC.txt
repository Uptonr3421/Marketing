Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Shearer's Foods LLC

Hi Kelsey,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Shearer's Foods LLC in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow small business owners in the events industry, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Event booking and client management consuming too much admin time
• Last-minute changes and menu customization requests
• Seasonal revenue fluctuations and cash flow management

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow small business owners in the events industry with:

• Streamlined booking systems that save 10+ hours per week
• Automated client communication and follow-ups
• Financial planning tools for seasonal businesses

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]

P.S. - As fellow LGBTQ+-allied businesses, supporting each other's success is what our community is all about.
