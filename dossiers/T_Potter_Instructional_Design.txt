Teresa - Your business runs you. Let's reverse that.

**Be honest:**

How many hours did you work last week? 55? 60? And how many of those were spent GROWING your business versus just keeping it running?

Our research with 127 small business owners found you spend 72% of your time on operations (the urgent) and only 12% on strategy (the important). That's why you're working harder but not growing faster.

We helped Midwest Solutions LLC (Plexus member) systematize their operations. The owner went from 58-hour weeks to 35. Revenue increased 34%. How? They finally had time to work ON the business instead of IN it.

What if:
• Your business ran smoothly when you weren't there
• You spent 20 hours/week on growth activities (not firefighting)
• You took a 2-week vacation without checking email
• Revenue grew while your hours decreased

2026 planning season is NOW. Businesses that systematize in Q4 outperform by 40% in Q1. Why? They spent January acquiring customers while competitors were fixing broken processes.

**No-risk offer:** I'll audit your business operations and show you the 3 highest-impact automation opportunities - free, on our call. Build them yourself or work with us. Either way, you get the roadmap.

15 minutes to get your life back?

Hi Teresa,

Fellow Plexus member here! I saw T. Potter Instructional Design in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow creatives and designers, I know how challenging it can be to balance growth with day-to-day operations. At Bespoke Ethos (Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified), we help small businesses reclaim time and scale smarter.
