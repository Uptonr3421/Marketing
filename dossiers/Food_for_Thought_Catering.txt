Amy - The $40K profit leak

**Amy, I almost didn't send this.**

But when I saw Food for Thought Catering in the Plexus directory, something clicked. You're doing what we help catering businesses fix every day - and it's costing you a full-time salary's worth of profit.

Here's what our research found: successful catering businesses waste 18 hours per week on manual booking, menu customization emails, and event coordination. At your rates, that's **$832 per week in lost billable time**. ($43,264 annually.)

We just helped Gather & Graze (fellow Plexus member) automate their client communication. Result? 12 hours back per week. They took on 3 more events per month without hiring.

What if you could:
• Handle 40% more events without adding staff
• Cut booking-to-contract time from 6 days to 1
• Stop answering the same menu questions at 11 PM
• Actually take a weekend off during wedding season

Here's why I'm reaching out now: Q1 2026 booking season starts in 8 weeks. The catering businesses in our network who automated BEFORE busy season captured 30% more bookings.

**Zero risk:** I'll share 3 automation quick wins on our call that you can implement yourself - whether we ever work together or not. Plexus members help each other.

15 minutes this week to show you the $40K leak? (And yes, I'll prove every number.)

P.S. - The caterers growing 50%+ this year all made ONE change. I'll tell you what it is on the call.
