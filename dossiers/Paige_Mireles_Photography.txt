Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Paige Mireles Photography

Hi Kiara,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Paige Mireles Photography in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow creative entrepreneurs, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Client acquisition and maintaining steady bookings
• Time spent on editing and post-production
• Managing client galleries and delivery

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow creative entrepreneurs with:

• Marketing automation to fill your booking calendar
• Workflow tools to cut editing time by 30%
• Automated gallery delivery and client communication

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,
