Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About International Live Events Association (ILEA) Cleveland

Hi Sarah,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across International Live Events Association (ILEA) Cleveland in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow event professionals, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Multiple vendor coordination and communication
• Client expectations and last-minute changes
• Seasonal business with uneven cash flow

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow event professionals with:

• Vendor coordination platforms saving hours per event
• Client portal systems managing expectations
• Financial tools for seasonal revenue planning

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]

P.S. - As fellow LGBTQ+-allied businesses, supporting each other's success is what our community is all about.
