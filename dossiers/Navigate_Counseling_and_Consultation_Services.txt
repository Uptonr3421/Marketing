Dr. Carson - You could serve 6 more patients/week

**You became a therapist to help people heal.**

Not to fight with insurance billing, manage no-shows, or spend Sunday nights on paperwork. Yet here we are.

Mental health professionals spend 12-14 hours weekly on admin. At your client rate ($120-180/session), that's 8-10 patients you COULD be serving. $62,400-93,600 in annual lost revenue. More importantly? 400+ sessions worth of healing that didn't happen.

We helped Akron Therapy Collective (Plexus members) automate their practice management. Result: 6.5 additional patient slots per week, 40% reduction in no-shows, and therapists going home at 5 PM instead of doing notes until 8.

What if:
• Insurance billing happened automatically (100% accurate)
• No-shows dropped 40% through automated reminders
• Session notes took 3 minutes, not 15
• Your schedule was full, but you weren't burnt out
• You served more people while working LESS

Mental health demand is at an all-time high. Your waiting list proves it. But you can't take new patients because you're drowning in admin. Every week you wait is 6 people who needed help but couldn't get in.

**My promise:** I'll show you the exact practice management system reducing admin by 10+ hours weekly - free on our call. HIPAA-compliant, therapist-designed, Plexus-proven. Use it or don't. Either way, you keep the knowledge.

15 minutes to serve 6 more people per week?

P.S. - The therapists in our network who automated? They're serving more patients, making more money, and reporting 70% less burnout. This is the answer.

Hi Karen,

Fellow Plexus member here! I saw Navigate Counseling and Consultation Services in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow mental health professionals, I know how challenging it can be to balance growth with day-to-day operations. At Bespoke Ethos (Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified), we help small businesses reclaim time and scale smarter.

Would love to share some quick wins from other fellow mental health professionals in our network – peer-to-peer, no pitch.

Open to connecting?
