Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Widenor Consulting LLC

Hi Ross,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Widenor Consulting LLC in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow consultants and service providers, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Client acquisition and building consistent pipeline
• Administrative work taking time away from billable hours
• Scaling beyond 1:1 client work

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow consultants and service providers with:

• Marketing systems that build your authority and attract clients
• Automation freeing 15+ hours per week for client work
• Productized offerings and scalable service models

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]

P.S. - As fellow LGBTQ+-allied businesses, supporting each other's success is what our community is all about.
