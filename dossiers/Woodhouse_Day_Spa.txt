Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Woodhouse Day Spa

Hi E,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Woodhouse Day Spa in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow wellness entrepreneurs, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Client retention and maintaining consistent attendance
• Scheduling and class management
• Payment processing and membership management

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow wellness entrepreneurs with:

• Retention systems keeping clients engaged
• Automated scheduling with waitlist management
• Seamless payment and membership automation

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]

P.S. - As fellow LGBTQ+-allied businesses, supporting each other's success is what our community is all about.
