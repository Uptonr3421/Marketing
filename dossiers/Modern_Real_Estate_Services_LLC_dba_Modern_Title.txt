Hi Kathy,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Modern Real Estate Services LLC dba Modern Title in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow real estate professionals, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Lead generation in competitive market

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow real estate professionals with:

• Lead nurturing systems that convert prospects
• Transaction coordination automation
• CRM systems managing your entire pipeline

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Best regards,
