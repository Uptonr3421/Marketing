Subject: Fellow Plexus Member – Quick Question About Big Creek Massotherapy

Hi Joni,

I'm reaching out as a fellow Plexus member and small business owner. I came across Big Creek Massotherapy in our community network and wanted to connect.

As fellow mental health professionals, I know firsthand the challenges we face:

• Administrative burden reducing time with clients
• Insurance billing and claims management complexity
• Client scheduling and no-show management

At Bespoke Ethos, we're a Catalant-vetted, NGLCC-certified consultancy specifically for small businesses like ours. We've helped fellow mental health professionals with:

• Practice management systems reducing admin by 50%
• Automated billing and insurance claim processing
• Smart scheduling with automated reminders

I'd love to share some quick wins that have worked for similar businesses in our Plexus community – no sales pitch, just peer-to-peer insights that might save you time or headaches.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in the next week or two?

Best regards,

[Your Name]

P.S. - As fellow LGBTQ+-allied businesses, supporting each other's success is what our community is all about.
