- MAJOR VERIFICATION GAP: The file contains specific claims about "started selling at age 11", "over 30 years", and "went full-time in 2021" that appear to be from a single source (likely an interview or personal communication) but these biographical details are NOT verified by multiple independent public sources.

📝 CORRECTIONS NEEDED:
- CLARIFY: Most viewed video count - File says "26 million" but wedding dress video is confirmed at "25 million". Recommend verifying if there's a different video with 26M or if this should be corrected to 25M.
- VERIFY: American Girl Cafes partnership - File specifically claims "American Girl Cafes national partnership - glitter bombs in kids' mocktails nationwide" but searches only confirm "partnership with American Girl" exists, not specific details about cafes and mocktails.
