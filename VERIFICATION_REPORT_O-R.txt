SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ERRORS
================================================================

🚨 CONTACT NAME MISMATCHES (8 out of 10 businesses):

1. Oasis Counseling Solutions: "Sandy Deida" should be "Mondie Gonzales"
2. Out Fitness Collective: "marcie Lambrix" should be "Josh Jones Forbes"
3. Paige Mireles Photography: "Shaun Chapman" should be "Paige Mireles"
4. Perkoski Photography: "Diane Brenna" should be "Bob Perkoski"
5. Pet-tique: "James Knapp" should be "Lawrence Carter and Kevin C."
6. Prestige Cleaning: "Allison Woods" should be "Chris" (last name unconfirmed)
7. Propped Productions: "Regina Bassett" should be "Rob" (last name unconfirmed)
8. Rainbow of Hope Counseling: "Lori Gabel" should be "Mary Wesley"

✅ CORRECT CONTACT NAMES (2 out of 10):
- Red Twig Floral Design: Michelle Touve-Holland ✓
- Rock The House: Email is generic info@, but Val Jones name is INCORRECT (should be Matt Radicelli)

🚨 DATE/TIMELINE ERRORS:

1. Perkoski Photography: "2010-2024" should be "since 2010" or "2010-present" (still active)
2. Out Fitness Collective: Opening date unclear (October 2022 vs January 2023)
3. Out Fitness Collective: News 5 coverage year needs verification (claimed 2025)

🚨 OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES:

1. Multiple businesses have email addresses that match the actual owner (e.g., jj@jjfit.pro, bob@perkoski.com, mmwesley@...) but wrong contact names listed
2. This pattern suggests possible data entry errors or mixing up of contact lists

================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
- Review source of contact names - appears to be systematic error across multiple files
- Verify all contact names before any outreach
- Cross-reference email addresses with actual business owners
- Update all 8 incorrect contact name entries
- Verify Out Fitness Collective opening date and News 5 coverage date
- Correct Perkoski Photography timeline

This verification was conducted using multiple independent web sources for each claim. All major factual claims were cross-referenced with at least 2-3 sources when possible.
