# ACTION PLAN: HOW TO MOVE FORWARD

**Created:** 2025-11-07
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE

---

## THE SITUATION:

✅ **What We Have:**
- 105 businesses deeply researched
- 85 sources on email personalization strategy
- 10 common ground themes identified
- Incredible personalization hooks and stories

⚠️ **The Problem:**
- Systematic contact name/email mismatches
- Some facts need verification
- Cannot send emails with wrong names (kills credibility in tight-knit community)

---

## THE SOLUTION: 3-PHASE APPROACH

### **PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE (Today) - Create "Safe to Contact" List**

**What to do:**
1. ✅ **Use the 10 verification reports** to identify businesses with:
   - Verified facts (no errors)
   - Correct contact names OR generic company emails

2. ✅ **Create Tier 1 Outreach List** (20-30 businesses):
   - All facts verified across multiple sources
   - Owner research is accurate
   - Contact info matches CSV

3. ✅ **Write 5 sample emails** using the verified research to show you what great looks like

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours
**Output:** Safe list of 20-30 businesses ready for outreach TODAY

---

### **PHASE 2: SHORT-TERM (This Week) - Fix & Expand**

**What to do:**
1. ✅ **Correct contact mismatches** for remaining 75 businesses:
   - Cross-reference owner names with CSV emails
   - Use generic company emails where owner not in CSV
   - Flag businesses needing direct verification

2. ✅ **Update research files** with corrections from verification reports

3. ✅ **Expand to Tier 2 List** (50 additional businesses)

**Timeline:** 1 week
**Output:** 80+ businesses with verified facts + correct contacts

---

### **PHASE 3: ONGOING - Systematic Outreach**

**What to do:**
1. ✅ **Send 10-20 emails per week** (sustainable pace)
2. ✅ **Track responses** and refine approach
3. ✅ **Ask for referrals** from responders (network effect)
4. ✅ **Attend Plexus events** and follow up with in-person connections

**Timeline:** Ongoing
**Output:** Steady pipeline of warm leads and clients

## DECISION POINT: WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO RIGHT NOW?

### **OPTION A: Fast Start (Recommended)**
**"Give me 20 verified businesses I can email TODAY"**

I will:
1. Pull businesses with verified facts + correct contacts from verification reports
2. Create prioritized list with personalization notes
3. Write 5 sample emails showing the approach
4. You can start outreach THIS WEEK

**Time:** 2 hours
**Risk:** Low (only using verified info)
**Reward:** Immediate action, quick feedback loop

---

### **OPTION B: Comprehensive Fix**
**"Fix ALL the contact mismatches first, then give me the list"**

I will:
1. Cross-reference all 105 businesses owner names with CSV
2. Create master corrected contact list
3. Update all research files with corrections
4. Give you complete verified database

**Time:** 1 week
**Risk:** None (everything verified)
**Reward:** Complete confidence in every contact

---

### **OPTION C: Hybrid Approach**
**"Give me 20 to start NOW, fix the rest in parallel"**

I will:
1. Immediately create Tier 1 list (20 verified businesses)
2. Write sample emails
3. Begin correction process for remaining 85 in background

**Time:** 2 hours for Tier 1, 1 week for rest
**Risk:** Low
**Reward:** Best of both worlds

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: **OPTION C (HYBRID)**

### Why?
1. **You can start outreach THIS WEEK** with 20 rock-solid contacts
2. **You get feedback fast** to refine approach before scaling
3. **No time wasted** - corrections happen while you're learning from first batch
4. **Lower risk** - if something's wrong, it's only 20 emails, not 100

### The 20 Businesses I'd Start With:

**VERIFIED + HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. **Allison L. Harrison Law** - All facts verified, contact matches
2. **Art of Sucre** - Emily Harpel, TikTok viral story verified
3. **India Ink Tattoo** - India Rush, NPR feature verified
4. **Cloak & Dagger** - Pandemic opening verified
5. **The Buckeye Flame** - National journalist award verified
6. **Snowbright Studio** - Games for Change award verified
7. **Yellowcake Shop** - Notable Latino Leader verified
8. **The Shinn Law Firm** - All major facts verified
9. **The Elliot** - Wedding venue details verified
10. **The Energy Producer** - $170K fundraising verified

(Plus 10 more from fully verified list)

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (IF YOU CHOOSE OPTION C):

### **TODAY:**
1. I create "TIER_1_SAFE_OUTREACH_LIST.md" with 20 businesses
2. Each entry has:
   - Correct contact name + email
   - Verified personalization hooks
   - Suggested email approach
   - Common ground angle

2. I write 5 sample emails using the strategy playbook

3. You review and approve approach

### **THIS WEEK:**
1. You send 10-20 emails (test batch)
2. I fix remaining 85 contacts in parallel
3. We refine based on response rates

### **NEXT WEEK:**
1. You have 80+ verified contacts ready
2. You're getting responses from first batch
3. You're asking for referrals
4. We scale to 20-30 emails per week

---

## RISK MITIGATION:

**What if we get something wrong in first 20?**
- We only email 20 people, not 100
- Tight-knit community impact is limited
- We fix before scaling

**What if response rates are low?**
- We refine approach before sending 80 more
- We test different angles/hooks
- We adjust based on data

**What if someone corrects a fact?**
- We thank them for the correction
- We update our database
- Shows we care about accuracy

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE:

**You have two choices:**

1. **Wait 1 week** until everything is perfect → Start outreach with 100% confidence

2. **Start THIS WEEK** with 20 verified → Learn fast, refine, then scale

**Both are valid. I recommend #2 because:**
- Speed to market matters
- You'll learn more from 20 real responses than 100 hours of planning
- The community is warm to Plexus members who show genuine interest

---

## YOUR DECISION:

**Tell me:**
- **Option A:** Give me 20 verified businesses NOW
- **Option B:** Fix everything first, then give me the list
- **Option C:** Give me 20 NOW + fix rest in parallel (RECOMMENDED)

**Or if you have a different approach in mind, tell me what you need.**

I'm ready to execute whichever path you choose. 💪
